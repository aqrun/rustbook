<p>Welcome to “The Rust Programming Language,” an introductory book about Rust.
Rust is a programming language that’s focused on safety, speed, and
concurrency. Its design lets you create programs that have the performance and
control of a low-level language, but with the powerful abstractions of a
high-level language. These properties make Rust suitable for programmers who
have experience in languages like C and are looking for a safer alternative, as
well as those from languages like Python who are looking for ways to write code
that performs better without sacrificing expressiveness.</p>
<p>Rust performs the majority of its safety checks and memory management decisions
at compile time, so that your program’s runtime performance isn’t impacted. This
makes it useful in a number of use cases that other languages aren’t good at:
programs with predictable space and time requirements, embedding in other
languages, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating
systems. It’s also great for web applications: it powers the Rust package
registry site, <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>!  We’re excited to see what <em>you</em> create with Rust.</p>
<p>This book is written for a reader who already knows how to program in at least
one programming language. After reading this book, you should be comfortable
writing Rust programs. We’ll be learning Rust through small, focused examples
that build on each other to demonstrate how to use various features of Rust as
well as how they work behind the scenes.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#installation" id="installation"><h2>Installation</h2></a>
<p>The first step to using Rust is to install it. You’ll need an internet
connection to run the commands in this chapter, as we’ll be downloading Rust
from the internet.</p>
<p>We’ll be showing off a number of commands using a terminal, and those lines all
start with <code>$</code>. You don’t need to type in the <code>$</code> character; they are there to indicate
the start of each command. You’ll see many tutorials and examples around the web
that follow this convention: <code>$</code> for commands run as a regular user, and <code>#</code>
for commands you should be running as an administrator. Lines that don’t start
with <code>$</code> are typically showing the output of the previous command.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#installing-on-linux-or-mac" id="installing-on-linux-or-mac"><h3>Installing on Linux or Mac</h3></a>
<p>If you’re on Linux or a Mac, all you need to do is open a terminal and type
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
</code></pre>
<p>This will download a script and start the installation. You may be prompted for
your password. If it all goes well, you’ll see this appear:</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#hello-world" id="hello-world"><h2>Hello, World!</h2></a>
<p>Now that you have Rust installed, let’s write your first Rust program. It’s
traditional when learning a new language to write a little program to print the
text “Hello, world!” to the screen, and in this section, we’ll follow that
tradition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This book assumes basic familiarity with the command line. Rust itself
makes no specific demands about your editing, tooling, or where your code
lives, so if you prefer an IDE to the command line, feel free to use your
favorite IDE.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-a-project-directory" id="creating-a-project-directory"><h3>Creating a Project Directory</h3></a>
<p>First, make a directory to put your Rust code in. Rust doesn’t care where your code
lives, but for this book, we’d suggest making a <em>projects</em> directory in your
home directory and keeping all your projects there. Open a terminal and enter
the following commands to make a directory for this particular project:</p>
<p>Linux and Mac:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
</code></pre>
<p>Windows CMD:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt; mkdir %USERPROFILE%\projects
&gt; cd %USERPROFILE%\projects
&gt; mkdir hello_world
&gt; cd hello_world
</code></pre>
<p>Windows PowerShell:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">&gt; mkdir $env:USERPROFILE\projects
&gt; cd $env:USERPROFILE\projects
&gt; mkdir hello_world
&gt; cd hello_world
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#writing-and-running-a-rust-program" id="writing-and-running-a-rust-program"><h3>Writing and Running a Rust Program</h3></a>
<p>Next, make a new source file and call it <em>main.rs</em>. Rust files always end with
the <em>.rs</em> extension. If you’re using more than one word in your filename, use
an underscore to separate them. For example, you’d use <em>hello_world.rs</em> rather
than <em>helloworld.rs</em>.</p>
<p>Now open the <em>main.rs</em> file you just created, and type the following code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Save the file, and go back to your terminal window. On Linux or OSX, enter the
following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>On Windows, run <code>.\main.exe</code> instead of <code>./main</code>. Regardless of your
operating system, you should see the string <code>Hello, world!</code> print to the
terminal. If you did, then congratulations! You’ve officially written a Rust
program. That makes you a Rust programmer! Welcome!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#anatomy-of-a-rust-program" id="anatomy-of-a-rust-program"><h3>Anatomy of a Rust Program</h3></a>
<p>Now, let’s go over what just happened in your “Hello, world!” program in
detail. Here’s the first piece of the puzzle:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {

}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>These lines define a <em>function</em> in Rust. The <code>main</code> function is special: it’s
the first thing that is run for every executable Rust program. The first line
says, “I’m declaring a function named <code>main</code> that has no parameters and returns
nothing.” If there were parameters, their names would go inside the
parentheses, <code>(</code> and <code>)</code>.</p>
<p>Also note that the function body is wrapped in curly brackets, <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>.
Rust requires these around all function bodies. It’s considered good style to
put the opening curly bracket on the same line as the function declaration,
with one space in between.</p>
<p>Inside the <code>main</code> function:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This line does all of the work in this little program: it prints text to the
screen. There are a number of details to notice here. The first is that Rust
style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.</p>
<p>The second important part is <code>println!</code>. This is calling a Rust <em>macro</em>,
which is how metaprogramming is done in Rust. If it were calling a function
instead, it would look like this: <code>println</code> (without the <code>!</code>). We’ll discuss
Rust macros in more detail in Appendix D, but for now you just need to know
that when you see a <code>!</code> that means that you’re calling a macro instead of a
normal function.</p>
<p>Next is <code>&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</code> which is a <em>string</em>. We pass this string as an
argument to <code>println!</code>, which prints the string to the screen. Easy enough!</p>
<p>The line ends with a semicolon (<code>;</code>). The <code>;</code> indicates that this expression is
over, and the next one is ready to begin. Most lines of Rust code end with a
<code>;</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#compiling-and-running-are-separate-steps" id="compiling-and-running-are-separate-steps"><h3>Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps</h3></a>
<p>In “Writing and Running a Rust Program”, we showed you how to run a newly
created program. We’ll break that process down and examine each step now.</p>
<p>Before running a Rust program, you have to compile it. You can use the Rust
compiler by entering the <code>rustc</code> command and passing it the name of your source
file, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ rustc main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>If you come from a C or C++ background, you’ll notice that this is similar to
<code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code>. After compiling successfully, Rust should output a binary
executable, which you can see on Linux or OSX by entering the <code>ls</code> command in
your shell as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ ls
main  main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>On Windows, you’d enter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt; dir /B %= the /B option says to only show the file names =%
main.exe
main.pdb
main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>This shows we have two files: the source code, with the <em>.rs</em> extension, and the
executable (<em>main.exe</em> on Windows, <em>main</em> everywhere else). All that’s left to
do from here is run the <em>main</em> or <em>main.exe</em> file, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ ./main  # or .\main.exe on Windows
</code></pre>
<p>If <em>main.rs</em> were your “Hello, world!” program, this would print <code>Hello, world!</code> to your terminal.</p>
<p>If you come from a dynamic language like Ruby, Python, or JavaScript, you may
not be used to compiling and running a program being separate steps. Rust is an
<em>ahead-of-time compiled</em> language, which means that you can compile a program,
give it to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust
installed. If you give someone a <code>.rb</code>, <code>.py</code>, or <code>.js</code> file, on the other
hand, they need to have a Ruby, Python, or JavaScript implementation installed
(respectively), but you only need one command to both compile and run your
program. Everything is a tradeoff in language design.</p>
<p>Just compiling with <code>rustc</code> is fine for simple programs, but as your project
grows, you’ll want to be able to manage all of the options your project has
and make it easy to share your code with other people and projects. Next, we’ll
introduce you to a tool called Cargo, which will help you write real-world Rust
programs.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#hello-cargo" id="hello-cargo"><h2>Hello, Cargo!</h2></a>
<p>Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager, and Rustaceans use Cargo to
manage their Rust projects because it makes a lot of tasks easier. For example,
Cargo takes care of building your code, downloading the libraries your code
depends on, and building those libraries. We call libraries your code needs
<em>dependencies</em>.</p>
<p>The simplest Rust programs, like the one we’ve written so far, don’t have any
dependencies, so right now, you’d only be using the part of Cargo that can take
care of building your code. As you write more complex Rust programs, you’ll
want to add dependencies, and if you start off using Cargo, that will be a lot
easier to do.</p>
<p>As the vast, vast majority of Rust projects use Cargo, we will assume that
you’re using it for the rest of the book. Cargo comes installed with Rust
itself, if you used the official installers as covered in the Installation
chapter. If you installed Rust through some other means, you can check if you
have Cargo installed by typing the following into your terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo --version
</code></pre>
<p>If you see a version number, great! If you see an error like <code>command not found</code>, then you should look at the documentation for your method of
installation to determine how to install Cargo separately.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-a-project-with-cargo" id="creating-a-project-with-cargo"><h3>Creating a Project with Cargo</h3></a>
<p>Let’s create a new project using Cargo and look at how it differs from our
project in <code>hello_world</code>. Go back to your projects directory (or wherever you
decided to put your code):</p>
<p>Linux and Mac:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cd ~/projects
</code></pre>
<p>Windows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt; cd %USERPROFILE%\projects
</code></pre>
<p>And then on any operating system run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo new hello_cargo --bin
$ cd hello_cargo
</code></pre>
<p>We passed the <code>--bin</code> argument to <code>cargo new</code> because our goal is to make an
executable application, as opposed to a library. Executables are binary
executable files often called just <em>binaries</em>. We’ve given <code>hello_cargo</code>
as the name for our project, and Cargo creates its files in a directory
of the same name that we can then go into.</p>
<p>If we list the files in the <em>hello_cargo</em> directory, we can see that Cargo has
generated two files and one directory for us: a <em>Cargo.toml</em> and a <em>src</em>
directory with a <em>main.rs</em> file inside. It has also initialized a new git
repository in the <em>hello_cargo</em> directory for us, along with a <em>.gitignore</em>
file; you can change this to use a different version control system, or no
version control system, by using the <code>--vcs</code> flag.</p>
<p>Open up <em>Cargo.toml</em> in your text editor of choice. It should look something
like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;hello_cargo&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;Your Name &lt;you@example.com&gt;&quot;]

[dependencies]
</code></pre>
<p>This file is in the <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml"><em>TOML</em></a><!-- ignore --> (Tom’s Obvious, Minimal
Language) format. TOML is similar to INI but has some extra goodies and is used
as Cargo’s configuration format.</p>
<p>The first line, <code>[package]</code>, is a section heading that indicates that the
following statements are configuring a package. As we add more information to
this file, we’ll add other sections.</p>
<p>The next three lines set the three bits of configuration that Cargo needs to
see in order to know that it should compile your program: its name, what
version it is, and who wrote it. Cargo gets your name and email information
from your environment. If it’s not correct, go ahead and fix that and save the
file.</p>
<p>The last line, <code>[dependencies]</code>, is the start of a section for you to list any
<em>crates</em> (which is what we call packages of Rust code) that your project will
depend on so that Cargo knows to download and compile those too. We won’t need
any other crates for this project, but we will in the guessing game tutorial in
the next chapter.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at <em>src/main.rs</em>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Cargo has generated a “Hello World!” for you, just like the one we wrote
earlier! So that part is the same. The differences between our previous project
and the project generated by Cargo that we’ve seen so far are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our code goes in the <em>src</em> directory</li>
<li>The top level contains a <em>Cargo.toml</em> configuration file</li>
</ul>
<p>Cargo expects your source files to live inside the <em>src</em> directory so that the
top-level project directory is just for READMEs, license information,
configuration files, and anything else not related to your code. In this way,
using Cargo helps you keep your projects nice and tidy. There’s a place for
everything, and everything is in its place.</p>
<p>If you started a project that doesn’t use Cargo, as we did with our project in
the <em>hello_world</em> directory, you can convert it to a project that does use
Cargo by moving your code into the <em>src</em> directory and creating an appropriate
<em>Cargo.toml</em>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#building-and-running-a-cargo-project" id="building-and-running-a-cargo-project"><h3>Building and Running a Cargo Project</h3></a>
<p>Now let’s look at what’s different about building and running your Hello World
program through Cargo! To do so, enter the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.85 secs
</code></pre>
<p>This should have created an executable file in <em>target/debug/hello_cargo</em> (or
<em>target\debug\hello_cargo.exe</em> on Windows), which you can run with this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo # or .\target\debug\hello_cargo.exe on Windows
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Bam! If all goes well, <code>Hello, world!</code> should print to the terminal once more.</p>
<p>Running <code>cargo build</code> for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file
at the top level called <em>Cargo.lock</em>, which looks like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.lock</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[root]
name = &quot;hello_cargo&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Cargo uses the <em>Cargo.lock</em> to keep track of dependencies in your application.
This project doesn’t have dependencies, so the file is a bit sparse.
Realistically, you won’t ever need to touch this file yourself; just let Cargo
handle it.</p>
<p>We just built a project with <code>cargo build</code> and ran it with
<code>./target/debug/hello_cargo</code>, but we can also use <code>cargo run</code> to compile
and then run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that this time, we didn’t see the output telling us that Cargo was
compiling <code>hello_cargo</code>. Cargo figured out that the files haven’t changed, so
it just ran the binary. If you had modified your source code, Cargo would have
rebuilt the project before running it, and you would have seen something like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33 secs
     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>So a few more differences we’ve now seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of using <code>rustc</code>, build a project using <code>cargo build</code> (or build and
run it in one step with <code>cargo run</code>)</li>
<li>Instead of the result of the build being put in the same directory as our
code, Cargo will put it in the <em>target/debug</em> directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no matter
what operating system you’re on, so at this point we will no longer be
providing specific instructions for Linux and Mac versus Windows.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#building-for-release" id="building-for-release"><h3>Building for Release</h3></a>
<p>When your project is finally ready for release, you can use <code>cargo build --release</code> to compile your project with optimizations. This will create an
executable in <em>target/release</em> instead of <em>target/debug</em>. These optimizations
make your Rust code run faster, but turning them on makes your program take
longer to compile. This is why there are two different profiles: one for
development when you want to be able to rebuild quickly and often, and one for
building the final program you’ll give to a user that won’t be rebuilt and
that we want to run as fast as possible. If you’re benchmarking the running
time of your code, be sure to run <code>cargo build --release</code> and benchmark with
the executable in <em>target/release</em>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#cargo-as-convention" id="cargo-as-convention"><h3>Cargo as Convention</h3></a>
<p>With simple projects, Cargo doesn’t provide a whole lot of value over just
using <code>rustc</code>, but it will prove its worth as you continue. With complex
projects composed of multiple crates, it’s much easier to let Cargo coordinate
the build. With Cargo, you can just run <code>cargo build</code>, and it should work the
right way. Even though this project is simple, it now uses much of the real
tooling you’ll use for the rest of your Rust career. In fact, you can get
started with virtually all Rust projects you want to work
on with the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ git clone someurl.com/someproject
$ cd someproject
$ cargo build
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you want to look at Cargo in more detail, check out the official
<a href="http://doc.crates.io/guide.html">Cargo guide</a>, which covers all of its features.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#guessing-game" id="guessing-game"><h1>Guessing Game</h1></a>
<p>Let’s jump into Rust by working through a hands-on project together! This
chapter introduces you to a few common Rust concepts by showing you how to use
them in a real program. You’ll learn about <code>let</code>, <code>match</code>, methods, associated
functions, using external crates, and more! The following chapters will explore
these ideas in more detail. In this chapter, you’ll practice the fundamentals.</p>
<p>We’ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here’s
how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It
will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After entering a guess, it will
indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the
game will print congratulations and exit.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#setting-up-a-new-project" id="setting-up-a-new-project"><h2>Setting Up a New Project</h2></a>
<p>To set up a new project, go to the <em>projects</em> directory that you created in
Chapter 1, and make a new project using Cargo, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo new guessing_game --bin
$ cd guessing_game
</code></pre>
<p>The first command, <code>cargo new</code>, takes the name of the project (<code>guessing_game</code>)
as the first argument. The <code>--bin</code> flag tells Cargo to make a binary project,
similar to the one in Chapter 1. The second command changes to the new
project’s directory.</p>
<p>Look at the generated <em>Cargo.toml</em> file:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;guessing_game&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;Your Name &lt;you@example.com&gt;&quot;]

[dependencies]
</code></pre>
<p>If the author information that Cargo obtained from your environment is not
correct, fix that in the file and save it again.</p>
<p>As you saw in Chapter 1, <code>cargo new</code> generates a “Hello, world!” program for
you. Check out the <em>src/main.rs</em> file:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Now let’s compile this “Hello, world!” program and run it in the same step
using the <code>cargo run</code> command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.50 secs
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>run</code> command comes in handy when you need to rapidly iterate on a project,
and this game is such a project: we want to quickly test each iteration
before moving on to the next one.</p>
<p>Reopen the <em>src/main.rs</em> file. You’ll be writing all the code in this file.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#processing-a-guess" id="processing-a-guess"><h2>Processing a Guess</h2></a>
<p>The first part of the program will ask for user input, process that input, and
check that the input is in the expected form. To start, we’ll allow the player
to input a guess. Enter the code in Listing 2-1 into <em>src/main.rs</em>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut guess)
        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);

    println!(&quot;You guessed: {}&quot;, guess);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 2-1: Code to get a guess from the user and print
it out</span></p>
<p>This code contains a lot of information, so let’s go over it bit by bit. To
obtain user input and then print the result as output, we need to bring the
<code>io</code> (input/output) library into scope. The <code>io</code> library comes from the
standard library (which is known as <code>std</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::io;
</code></pre>
<p>By default, Rust brings only a few types into the scope of every program in
<a href="../../std/prelude/index.html">the <em>prelude</em></a><!-- ignore -->. If a type you want to use isn’t in the
prelude, you have to bring that type into scope explicitly with a <code>use</code>
statement. Using the <code>std::io</code> library provides you with a number of useful
<code>io</code>-related features, including the functionality to accept user input.</p>
<p>As you saw in Chapter 1, the <code>main</code> function is the entry point into the
program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>fn</code> syntax declares a new function, the <code>()</code> indicate there are no
parameters, and <code>{</code> starts the body of the function.</p>
<p>As you also learned in Chapter 1, <code>println!</code> is a macro that prints a string to
the screen:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>This code is printing a prompt stating what the game is and requesting input
from the user.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#storing-values-with-variables" id="storing-values-with-variables"><h3>Storing Values with Variables</h3></a>
<p>Next, we’ll create a place to store the user input, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut guess = String::new();
</code></pre>
<p>Now the program is getting interesting! There’s a lot going on in this little
line. Notice that this is a <code>let</code> statement, which is used to create
<em>variables</em>. Here’s another example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let foo = bar;
</code></pre>
<p>This line will create a new variable named <code>foo</code> and bind it to the value
<code>bar</code>. In Rust, variables are immutable by default. The following example shows
how to use <code>mut</code> before the variable name to make a variable mutable:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let foo = 5; // immutable
let mut bar = 5; // mutable
#}</code></pre></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The <code>//</code> syntax starts a comment that continues until the end of the
line. Rust ignores everything in comments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now you know that <code>let mut guess</code> will introduce a mutable variable named
<code>guess</code>. On the other side of the equal sign (<code>=</code>) is the value that <code>guess</code> is
bound to, which is the result of calling <code>String::new</code>, a function that returns
a new instance of a <code>String</code>. <a href="../../std/string/struct.String.html"><code>String</code></a><!-- ignore --> is a string
type provided by the standard library that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of
text.</p>
<p>The <code>::</code> syntax in the <code>::new</code> line indicates that <code>new</code> is an <em>associated
function</em> of the <code>String</code> type. An associated function is implemented on a type,
in this case <code>String</code>, rather than on a particular instance of a <code>String</code>. Some
languages call this a <em>static method</em>.</p>
<p>This <code>new</code> function creates a new, empty <code>String</code>. You’ll find a <code>new</code> function
on many types, because it’s a common name for a function that makes a new value
of some kind.</p>
<p>To summarize, the <code>let mut guess = String::new();</code> line has created a mutable
variable that is currently bound to a new, empty instance of a <code>String</code>. Whew!</p>
<p>Recall that we included the input/output functionality from the standard
library with <code>use std::io;</code> on the first line of the program. Now we’ll call an
associated function, <code>stdin</code>, on <code>io</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut guess)
    .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>If we didn’t have the <code>use std::io</code> line at the beginning of the program, we
could have written this function call as <code>std::io::stdin</code>. The <code>stdin</code> function
returns an instance of <a href="../../std/io/struct.Stdin.html"><code>std::io::Stdin</code></a><!-- ignore -->, which is a
type that represents a handle to the standard input for your terminal.</p>
<p>The next part of the code, <code>.read_line(&amp;mut guess)</code>, calls the
<a href="../../std/io/struct.Stdin.html#method.read_line"><code>read_line</code></a><!-- ignore --> method on the standard input handle to
get input from the user. We’re also passing one argument to <code>read_line</code>: <code>&amp;mut guess</code>.</p>
<p>The job of <code>read_line</code> is to take whatever the user types into standard input
and place that into a string, so it takes that string as an argument. The
string argument needs to be mutable so the method can change the string’s
content by adding the user input.</p>
<p>The <code>&amp;</code> indicates that this argument is a <em>reference</em>, which gives you a way to
let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to
copy that data into memory multiple times. References are a complex feature,
and one of Rust’s major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use
references. You don’t need to know a lot of those details to finish this
program: Chapter 4 will explain references more thoroughly. For now, all you
need to know is that like variables, references are immutable by default.
Hence, we need to write <code>&amp;mut guess</code> rather than <code>&amp;guess</code> to make it mutable.</p>
<p>We’re not quite done with this line of code. Although it’s a single line of
text, it’s only the first part of the single logical line of code. The second
part is this method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">.expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>When you call a method with the <code>.foo()</code> syntax, it’s often wise to introduce a
newline and other whitespace to help break up long lines. We could have
written this code as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut guess).expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>However, one long line is difficult to read, so it’s best to divide it, two
lines for two method calls. Now let’s discuss what this line does.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#handling-potential-failure-with-the-result-type" id="handling-potential-failure-with-the-result-type"><h3>Handling Potential Failure with the <code>Result</code> Type</h3></a>
<p>As mentioned earlier, <code>read_line</code> puts what the user types into the string we’re
passing it, but it also returns a value—in this case, an
<a href="../../std/io/type.Result.html"><code>io::Result</code></a><!-- ignore -->. Rust has a number of types named
<code>Result</code> in its standard library: a generic <a href="../../std/result/enum.Result.html"><code>Result</code></a><!-- ignore --> as
well as specific versions for submodules, such as <code>io::Result</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Result</code> types are <a href="ch06-00-enums.html"><em>enumerations</em></a><!-- ignore -->, often referred
to as <em>enums</em>. An enumeration is a type that can have a fixed set of values,
and those values are called the enum’s <em>variants</em>. Chapter 6 will cover enums
in more detail.</p>
<p>For <code>Result</code>, the variants are <code>Ok</code> or <code>Err</code>. <code>Ok</code> indicates the operation was
successful, and inside the <code>Ok</code> variant is the successfully generated value.
<code>Err</code> means the operation failed, and <code>Err</code> contains information about how or
why the operation failed.</p>
<p>The purpose of these <code>Result</code> types is to encode error handling information.
Values of the <code>Result</code> type, like any type, have methods defined on them. An
instance of <code>io::Result</code> has an <a href="../../std/result/enum.Result.html#method.expect"><code>expect</code> method</a><!-- ignore --> that
you can call. If this instance of <code>io::Result</code> is an <code>Err</code> value, <code>expect</code> will
cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an
argument to <code>expect</code>. If the <code>read_line</code> method returns an <code>Err</code>, it would
likely be the result of an error coming from the underlying operating system.
If this instance of <code>io::Result</code> is an <code>Ok</code> value, <code>expect</code> will take the
return value that <code>Ok</code> is holding and return just that value to you so you
could use it. In this case, that value is the number of bytes in what the user
entered into standard input.</p>
<p>If we don’t call <code>expect</code>, the program will compile, but we’ll get a warning:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build

   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |
   = note: #[warn(unused_must_use)] on by default
</code></pre>
<p>Rust warns that we haven’t used the <code>Result</code> value returned from <code>read_line</code>,
indicating that the program hasn’t handled a possible error. The right way to
suppress the warning is to actually write error handling, but since we want to
crash this program when a problem occurs, we can use <code>expect</code>. You’ll learn
about recovering from errors in Chapter 9.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#printing-values-with-println-placeholders" id="printing-values-with-println-placeholders"><h3>Printing Values with <code>println!</code> Placeholders</h3></a>
<p>Aside from the closing curly brackets, there’s only one more line to discuss in
the code added so far, which is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">println!(&quot;You guessed: {}&quot;, guess);
</code></pre>
<p>This line prints out the string we saved the user’s input in. The set of <code>{}</code>
is a placeholder that holds a value in place. You can print more than one value
using <code>{}</code>: the first set of <code>{}</code> holds the first value listed after the format
string, the second set holds the second value, and so on. Printing out multiple
values in one call to <code>println!</code> would look like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let x = 5;
let y = 10;

println!(&quot;x = {} and y = {}&quot;, x, y);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code would print out <code>x = 5 and y = 10</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#testing-the-first-part" id="testing-the-first-part"><h3>Testing the First Part</h3></a>
<p>Let’s test the first part of the guessing game. You can run it using

<p>At this point, the first part of the game is done: we’re getting input from the
keyboard and then printing it.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#generating-a-secret-number" id="generating-a-secret-number"><h2>Generating a Secret Number</h2></a>
<p>Next, we need to generate a secret number that the user will try to guess. The
secret number should be different every time so the game is fun to play more
than once. Let’s use a random number between 1 and 100 so the game isn’t too
difficult. Rust doesn’t yet include random number functionality in its standard
library. However, the Rust team does provide a <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rand"><code>rand</code> crate</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality" id="using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality"><h3>Using a Crate to Get More Functionality</h3></a>
<p>Remember that a <em>crate</em> is a package of Rust code. The project we’ve been
building is a <em>binary crate</em>, which is an executable. The <code>rand</code> crate is a
<em>library crate</em>, which contains code intended to be used in other programs.</p>
<p>Cargo’s use of external crates is where it really shines. Before we can write
code that uses <code>rand</code>, we need to modify the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file to include the
<code>rand</code> crate as a dependency. Open that file now and add the following line to
the bottom beneath the <code>[dependencies]</code> section header that Cargo created for
you:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]

rand = &quot;0.3.14&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file, everything that follows a header is part of a section
that continues until another section starts. The <code>[dependencies]</code> section is
where you tell Cargo which external crates your project depends on and which
versions of those crates you require. In this case, we’ll specify the <code>rand</code>
crate with the semantic version specifier <code>0.3.14</code>. Cargo understands <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic
Versioning</a><!-- ignore --> (sometimes called <em>SemVer</em>), which is a
standard for writing version numbers. The number <code>0.3.14</code> is actually shorthand
for <code>^0.3.14</code>, which means “any version that has a public API compatible with
version 0.3.14.”</p>
<p>Now, without changing any of the code, let’s build the project, as shown in
Listing 2-2:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build
    Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
 Downloading rand v0.3.14
 Downloading libc v0.2.14
   Compiling libc v0.2.14
   Compiling rand v0.3.14
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.53 secs
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 2-2: The output from running <code>cargo build</code> after
adding the rand crate as a dependency</span></p>
<p>You may see different version numbers (but they will all be compatible with
the code, thanks to SemVer!), and the lines may be in a different order.</p>
<p>Now that we have an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest versions of
everything from the <em>registry</em>, which is a copy of data from
<a href="https://crates.io">Crates.io</a>. Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem post
their open source Rust projects for others to use.</p>
<p>After updating the registry, Cargo checks the <code>[dependencies]</code> section and
downloads any you don’t have yet. In this case, although we only listed <code>rand</code>
as a dependency, Cargo also grabbed a copy of <code>libc</code>, because <code>rand</code> depends on
<code>libc</code> to work. After downloading them, Rust compiles them and then compiles
the project with the dependencies available.</p>
<p>If you immediately run <code>cargo build</code> again without making any changes, you won’t
get any output. Cargo knows it has already downloaded and compiled the
dependencies, and you haven’t changed anything about them in your <em>Cargo.toml</em>
file. Cargo also knows that you haven’t changed anything about your code, so it
doesn’t recompile that either. With nothing to do, it simply exits. If you open
up the <em>src/main.rs</em> file, make a trivial change, then save it and build again,
you’ll only see two lines of output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.53 secs
</code></pre>
<p>These lines show Cargo only updates the build with your tiny change to the
<em>src/main.rs</em> file. Your dependencies haven’t changed, so Cargo knows it can
reuse what it has already downloaded and compiled for those. It just rebuilds
your part of the code.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-cargolock-file-ensures-reproducible-builds" id="the-cargolock-file-ensures-reproducible-builds"><h4>The <em>Cargo.lock</em> File Ensures Reproducible Builds</h4></a>
<p>Cargo has a mechanism that ensures you can rebuild the same artifact every time
you or anyone else builds your code: Cargo will use only the versions of the
dependencies you specified until you indicate otherwise. For example, what
happens if next week version <code>v0.3.15</code> of the <code>rand</code> crate comes out and
contains an important bug fix but also contains a regression that will break
your code?</p>
<p>The answer to this problem is the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file, which was created the
first time you ran <code>cargo build</code> and is now in your <em>guessing_game</em> directory.
When you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the
versions of the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them to
the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file. When you build your project in the future, Cargo will
see that the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file exists and use the versions specified there
rather than doing all the work of figuring out versions again. This lets you
have a reproducible build automatically. In other words, your project will
remain at <code>0.3.14</code> until you explicitly upgrade, thanks to the <em>Cargo.lock</em>
file.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#updating-a-crate-to-get-a-new-version" id="updating-a-crate-to-get-a-new-version"><h4>Updating a Crate to Get a New Version</h4></a>
<p>When you <em>do</em> want to update a crate, Cargo provides another command, <code>update</code>,
which will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ignore the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file and figure out all the latest versions that fit
your specifications in <em>Cargo.toml</em>.</li>
<li>If that works, Cargo will write those versions to the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file.</li>
</ol>
<p>But by default, Cargo will only look for versions larger than <code>0.3.0</code> and
smaller than <code>0.4.0</code>. If the <code>rand</code> crate has released two new versions,
<code>0.3.15</code> and <code>0.4.0</code>, you would see the following if you ran <code>cargo update</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo update
    Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
    Updating rand v0.3.14 -&gt; v0.3.15
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, you would also notice a change in your <em>Cargo.lock</em> file noting
that the version of the <code>rand</code> crate you are now using is <code>0.3.15</code>.</p>
<p>If you wanted to use <code>rand</code> version <code>0.4.0</code> or any version in the <code>0.4.x</code>
series, you’d have to update the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file to look like this instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]

rand = &quot;0.4.0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The next time you run <code>cargo build</code>, Cargo will update the registry of crates
available and reevaluate your <code>rand</code> requirements according to the new version
you specified.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to say about <a href="http://doc.crates.io">Cargo</a><!-- ignore --> and <a href="http://doc.crates.io/crates-io.html">its
ecosystem</a><!-- ignore --> that Chapter 14 will discuss, but for
now, that’s all you need to know. Cargo makes it very easy to reuse libraries,
so Rustaceans are able to write smaller projects that are assembled from a
number of packages.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#generating-a-random-number" id="generating-a-random-number"><h3>Generating a Random Number</h3></a>
<p>Let’s start <em>using</em> <code>rand</code>. The next step is to update <em>src/main.rs</em>, as shown
in Listing 2-3:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate rand;

use std::io;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);

    println!(&quot;The secret number is: {}&quot;, secret_number);

    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut guess)
        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);

    println!(&quot;You guessed: {}&quot;, guess);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 2-3: Code changes needed in order to generate a
random number</span></p>
<p>We’re adding a <code>extern crate rand;</code> line to the top that lets Rust know we’ll be
using that external dependency. This also does the equivalent of calling <code>use rand</code>, so now we can call anything in the <code>rand</code> crate by prefixing it with
<code>rand::</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we’re adding another <code>use</code> line: <code>use rand::Rng</code>. <code>Rng</code> is a trait that
defines methods that random number generators implement, and this trait must be
in scope for us to use those methods. Chapter 10 will cover traits in detail.</p>
<p>Also, we’re adding two more lines in the middle. The <code>rand::thread_rng</code> function
will give us the particular random number generator that we’re going to use:
one that is local to the current thread of execution and seeded by the
operating system. Next, we call the <code>gen_range</code> method on the random number
generator. This method is defined by the <code>Rng</code> trait that we brought into
scope with the <code>use rand::Rng</code> statement. The <code>gen_range</code> method takes two
numbers as arguments and generates a random number between them. It’s inclusive
on the lower bound but exclusive on the upper bound, so we need to specify <code>1</code>
and <code>101</code> to request a number between 1 and 100.</p>
<p>Knowing which traits to use and which functions and methods to call from a
crate isn’t something that you’ll just <em>know</em>. Instructions for using a crate
are in each crate’s documentation. Another neat feature of Cargo is that you
can run the <code>cargo doc --open</code> command that will build documentation provided
by all of your dependencies locally and open it in your browser. If you’re
interested in other functionality in the <code>rand</code> crate, for example, run <code>cargo doc --open</code> and click <code>rand</code> in the sidebar on the left.</p>
<p>The second line that we added to the code prints the secret number. This is
useful while we’re developing the program to be able to test it, but we’ll
delete it from the final version. It’s not much of a game if the program prints
the answer as soon as it starts!</p>
<p>Try running the program a few times:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run

</code></pre>
<p>You should get different random numbers, and they should all be numbers between
1 and 100. Great job!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number" id="comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number"><h2>Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number</h2></a>
<p>Now that we have user input and a random number, we can compare them. That
step is shown in Listing 2-4:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate rand;

use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);

    println!(&quot;The secret number is: {}&quot;, secret_number);

    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut guess)
        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);

    println!(&quot;You guessed: {}&quot;, guess);

    match guess.cmp(&amp;secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less =&gt; println!(&quot;Too small!&quot;),
        Ordering::Greater =&gt; println!(&quot;Too big!&quot;),
        Ordering::Equal =&gt; println!(&quot;You win!&quot;),
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 2-4: Handling the possible return values of
comparing two numbers</span></p>
<p>The first new bit here is another <code>use</code>, bringing a type called
<code>std::cmp::Ordering</code> into scope from the standard library. <code>Ordering</code> is
another enum, like <code>Result</code>, but the variants for <code>Ordering</code> are <code>Less</code>,
<code>Greater</code>, and <code>Equal</code>. These are the three outcomes that are possible when you
compare two values.</p>
<p>Then we add five new lines at the bottom that use the <code>Ordering</code> type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">match guess.cmp(&amp;secret_number) {
    Ordering::Less =&gt; println!(&quot;Too small!&quot;),
    Ordering::Greater =&gt; println!(&quot;Too big!&quot;),
    Ordering::Equal =&gt; println!(&quot;You win!&quot;),
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>cmp</code> method compares two values and can be called on anything that can be
compared. It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with: here it’s
comparing the <code>guess</code> to the <code>secret_number</code>. <code>cmp</code> returns a variant of the
<code>Ordering</code> enum we brought into scope with the <code>use</code> statement. We use a
<a href="ch06-02-match.html"><code>match</code></a><!-- ignore --> expression to decide what to do next based on
which variant of <code>Ordering</code> was returned from the call to <code>cmp</code> with the values
in <code>guess</code> and <code>secret_number</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>match</code> expression is made up of <em>arms</em>. An arm consists of a <em>pattern</em> and
the code that should be run if the value given to the beginning of the <code>match</code>
expression fits that arm’s pattern. Rust takes the value given to <code>match</code> and
looks through each arm’s pattern in turn. The <code>match</code> construct and patterns
are powerful features in Rust that let you express a variety of situations your
code might encounter and helps ensure that you handle them all. These features
will be covered in detail in Chapter 6 and Chapter 18, respectively.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through an example of what would happen with the <code>match</code> expression
used here. Say that the user has guessed 50, and the randomly generated secret
number this time is 38. When the code compares 50 to 38, the <code>cmp</code> method will
return <code>Ordering::Greater</code>, because 50 is greater than 38. <code>Ordering::Greater</code>
is the value that the <code>match</code> expression gets. It looks at the first arm’s
pattern, <code>Ordering::Less</code>, but the value <code>Ordering::Greater</code> does not match
<code>Ordering::Less</code>, so it ignores the code in that arm and moves to the next arm.
The next arm’s pattern, <code>Ordering::Greater</code>, <em>does</em> match
<code>Ordering::Greater</code>! The associated code in that arm will execute and print
<code>Too big!</code> to the screen. The <code>match</code> expression ends because it has no need to
look at the last arm in this particular scenario.</p>
<p>However, the code in Listing 2-4 won’t compile yet. Let’s try it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --&gt; src/main.rs:23:21

   |
   = note: expected type `&amp;std::string::String`
   = note:    found type `&amp;{integer}`

error: aborting due to previous error
Could not compile `guessing_game`.
</code></pre>
<p>The core of the error states that there are <em>mismatched types</em>. Rust has a
strong, static type system. However, it also has type inference. When we wrote
<code>let guess = String::new()</code>, Rust was able to infer that <code>guess</code> should be a
<code>String</code> and didn’t make us write the type. The <code>secret_number</code>, on the other
hand, is a number type. A few number types can have a value between 1 and 100:
<code>i32</code>, a 32-bit number; <code>u32</code>, an unsigned 32-bit number; <code>i64</code>, a 64-bit
number; as well as others. Rust defaults to an <code>i32</code>, which is the type of
<code>secret_number</code> unless we add type information elsewhere that would cause Rust
to infer a different numerical type. The reason for the error is that Rust will
not compare a string and a number type.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we want to convert the <code>String</code> the program reads as input into a
real number type so we can compare it to the guess numerically. We can do
that by adding the following two lines to the <code>main</code> function body:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate rand;

use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

<p>The two new lines are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse()
    .expect(&quot;Please type a number!&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>We create a variable named <code>guess</code>. But wait, doesn’t the program
already have a variable named <code>guess</code>? It does, but Rust allows us to
<em>shadow</em> the previous value of <code>guess</code> with a new one. This feature is often
used in similar situations in which you want to convert a value from one type
to another type. Shadowing lets us reuse the <code>guess</code> variable name rather than
forcing us to create two unique variables, like <code>guess_str</code> and <code>guess</code> for
example. (Chapter 3 covers shadowing in more detail.)</p>
<p>We bind <code>guess</code> to the expression <code>guess.trim().parse()</code>. The <code>guess</code> in the
expression refers to the original <code>guess</code> that was a <code>String</code> with the input in
it. The <code>trim</code> method on a <code>String</code> instance will eliminate any whitespace at
the beginning and end. <code>u32</code> can only contain numerical characters, but the
user must press the <span class="keystroke">enter</span> key to satisfy
<code>read_line</code>. When the user presses <span class="keystroke">enter</span>, a
newline character is added to the string. For example, if the user types <span
class="keystroke">5</span> and presses <span class="keystroke"> enter</span>,
<code>guess</code> looks like this: <code>5\n</code>. The <code>\n</code> represents “newline,” the enter key.
The <code>trim</code> method eliminates <code>\n</code>, resulting in just <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../std/primitive.str.html#method.parse"><code>parse</code> method on strings</a><!-- ignore --> parses a string into some
kind of number. Because this method can parse a variety of number types, we
need to tell Rust the exact number type we want by using <code>let guess: u32</code>. The
colon (<code>:</code>) after <code>guess</code> tells Rust we’ll annotate the variable’s type. Rust
has a few built-in number types; the <code>u32</code> seen here is an unsigned, 32-bit
integer. It’s a good default choice for a small positive number. You’ll learn
about other number types in Chapter 3. Additionally, the <code>u32</code> annotation in
this example program and the comparison with <code>secret_number</code> means that Rust
will infer that <code>secret_number</code> should be a <code>u32</code> as well. So now the
comparison will be between two values of the same type!</p>
<p>The call to <code>parse</code> could easily cause an error. If, for example, the string
contained <code>A👍%</code>, there would be no way to convert that to a number. Because it
might fail, the <code>parse</code> method returns a <code>Result</code> type, much like the
<code>read_line</code> method does as discussed earlier in “Handling Potential Failure
with the Result Type”. We’ll treat this <code>Result</code> the same way by
using the <code>expect</code> method again. If <code>parse</code> returns an <code>Err</code> <code>Result</code> variant
because it couldn’t create a number from the string, the <code>expect</code> call will
crash the game and print the message we give it. If <code>parse</code> can successfully
convert the string to a number, it will return the <code>Ok</code> variant of <code>Result</code>,
and <code>expect</code> will return the number that we want from the <code>Ok</code> value.</p>
<p>Let’s run the program now!</p>

<p>Nice! Even though spaces were added before the guess, the program still figured
out that the user guessed 76. Run the program a few times to verify the
different behavior with different kinds of input: guess the number correctly,
guess a number that is too high, and guess a number that is too low.</p>
<p>We have most of the game working now, but the user can make only one guess.
Let’s change that by adding a loop!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#allowing-multiple-guesses-with-looping" id="allowing-multiple-guesses-with-looping"><h2>Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping</h2></a>
<p>The <code>loop</code> keyword gives us an infinite loop. Add that now to give users more
chances at guessing the number:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate rand;

use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);

    println!(&quot;The secret number is: {}&quot;, secret_number);

    loop {
        println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);

        let mut guess = String::new();

        io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut guess)

<p>As you can see, we’ve moved everything into a loop from the guess input prompt
onward. Be sure to indent those lines another four spaces each, and run the
program again. Notice that there is a new problem because the program is doing
exactly what we told it to do: ask for another guess forever! It doesn’t seem
like the user can quit!</p>
<p>The user could always halt the program by using the keyboard shortcut
<span class="keystroke">ctrl-C</span>. But there’s another way to escape this
insatiable monster that we mentioned in the <code>parse</code> discussion in “Comparing the
Guess to the Secret Number”: if the user enters a non-number answer, the program
will crash. The user can take advantage of that in order to quit, as shown here:</p>

<p>Typing <code>quit</code> actually quits the game, but so will any other non-number input.
However, this is suboptimal to say the least. We want the game to automatically

<a class="header" href="print.html#quitting-after-a-correct-guess" id="quitting-after-a-correct-guess"><h3>Quitting After a Correct Guess</h3></a>
<p>Let’s program the game to quit when the user wins by adding a <code>break</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate rand;

use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);

    println!(&quot;The secret number is: {}&quot;, secret_number);

    loop {
        println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);

        let mut guess = String::new();

        io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut guess)
            .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);

        let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse()
            .expect(&quot;Please type a number!&quot;);

        println!(&quot;You guessed: {}&quot;, guess);

        match guess.cmp(&amp;secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less =&gt; println!(&quot;Too small!&quot;),
            Ordering::Greater =&gt; println!(&quot;Too big!&quot;),
            Ordering::Equal =&gt; {
                println!(&quot;You win!&quot;);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>By adding the <code>break</code> line after <code>You win!</code>, the program will exit the loop
when the user guesses the secret number correctly. Exiting the loop also means
exiting the program, because the loop is the last part of <code>main</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#handling-invalid-input" id="handling-invalid-input"><h3>Handling Invalid Input</h3></a>
<p>To further refine the game’s behavior, rather than crashing the program when
the user inputs a non-number, let’s make the game ignore a non-number so the
user can continue guessing. We can do that by altering the line where <code>guess</code> is
converted from a <code>String</code> to a <code>u32</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
    Ok(num) =&gt; num,
    Err(_) =&gt; continue,
};
</code></pre>
<p>Switching from an <code>expect</code> call to a <code>match</code> expression is how you generally
move from crash on error to actually handling the error. Remember that <code>parse</code>
returns a <code>Result</code> type, and <code>Result</code> is an enum that has the variants <code>Ok</code> or
<code>Err</code>. We’re using a <code>match</code> expression here, like we did with the <code>Ordering</code>
result of the <code>cmp</code> method.</p>
<p>If <code>parse</code> is able to successfully turn the string into a number, it will return
an <code>Ok</code> value that contains the resulting number. That <code>Ok</code> value will match the
first arm’s pattern, and the <code>match</code> expression will just return the <code>num</code> value
that <code>parse</code> produced and put inside the <code>Ok</code> value. That number will end up
right where we want it in the new <code>guess</code> variable we’re creating.</p>
<p>If <code>parse</code> is <em>not</em> able to turn the string into a number, it will return an
<code>Err</code> value that contains more information about the error. The <code>Err</code> value
does not match the <code>Ok(num)</code> pattern in the first <code>match</code> arm, but it does match
the <code>Err(_)</code> pattern in the second arm. The <code>_</code> is a catchall value; in this
example, we’re saying we want to match all <code>Err</code> values, no matter what
information they have inside them. So the program will execute the second arm’s
code, <code>continue</code>, which means to go to the next iteration of the <code>loop</code> and ask
for another guess. So effectively, the program ignores all errors that <code>parse</code>
might encounter!</p>
<p>Now everything in the program should work as expected. Let’s try it by running
<code>cargo run</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run

</code></pre>
<p>Awesome! With one tiny final tweak, we will finish the guessing game: recall
that the program is still printing out the secret number. That worked well for
testing, but it ruins the game. Let’s delete the <code>println!</code> that outputs the
secret number. Listing 2-5 shows the final code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

        let mut guess = String::new();

<a class="header" href="print.html#summary" id="summary"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>At this point, you’ve successfully built the guessing game! Congratulations!</p>
<p>This project was a hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts:
<code>let</code>, <code>match</code>, methods, associated functions, using external crates, and more.
In the next few chapters, you’ll learn about these concepts in more detail.
Chapter 3 covers concepts that most programming languages have, such as
variables, data types, and functions, and shows how to use them in Rust.
Chapter 4 explores ownership, which is a Rust feature that is most different
from other languages. Chapter 5 discusses structs and method syntax, and
Chapter 6 endeavors to explain enums.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#common-programming-concepts" id="common-programming-concepts"><h1>Common Programming Concepts</h1></a>
<p>This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language
and how they work in Rust. Many programming languages have much in common at
their core. None of the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Rust,
but we’ll discuss them in the context of Rust and explain their conventions.</p>
<p>Specifically, you’ll learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments,
and control flow. These foundations will be in every Rust program, and learning
them early will give you a strong core to start from.</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#keywords" id="keywords"><h3>Keywords</h3></a>
<p>The Rust language has a set of <em>keywords</em> that have been reserved for use by
the language only, much like other languages do. Keep in mind that you cannot
use these words as names of variables or functions. Most of the keywords have
special meanings, and you’ll be using them to do various tasks in your Rust
programs; a few have no current functionality associated with them but have
been reserved for functionality that might be added to Rust in the future. You
can find a list of the keywords in Appendix A.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#variables-and-mutability" id="variables-and-mutability"><h2>Variables and Mutability</h2></a>
<p>As mentioned in Chapter 2, by default variables are <em>immutable</em>. This is one of
many nudges in Rust that encourages you to write your code in a way that takes
advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers. However, you
still have the option to make your variables mutable. Let’s explore how and why
Rust encourages you to favor immutability, and why you might want to opt out.</p>
<p>When a variable is immutable, that means once a value is bound to a name, you
can’t change that value. To illustrate, let’s generate a new project called
<em>variables</em> in your <em>projects</em> directory by using <code>cargo new --bin variables</code>.</p>
<p>Then, in your new <em>variables</em> directory, open <em>src/main.rs</em> and replace its
code with the following:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {}&quot;, x);
    x = 6;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {}&quot;, x);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Save and run the program using <code>cargo run</code>. You should receive an error
message, as shown in this output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
 --&gt; src/main.rs:4:5
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         - first assignment to `x`
3 |     println!(&quot;The value of x is: {}&quot;, x);
4 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
</code></pre>
<p>This example shows how the compiler helps you find errors in your programs.
Even though compiler errors can be frustrating, they only mean your program
isn’t safely doing what you want it to do yet; they do <em>not</em> mean that you’re
not a good programmer! Experienced Rustaceans still get compiler errors.</p>
<p>The error indicates that the cause of the error is that we <code>cannot assign twice to immutable variable x</code>, because we tried to assign a second value to the
immutable <code>x</code> variable.</p>
<p>It’s important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a
value that we previously designated as immutable because this very situation
can lead to bugs. If one part of our code operates on the assumption that a
value will never change and another part of our code changes that value, it’s
possible that the first part of the code won’t do what it was designed to do.
This cause of bugs can be difficult to track down after the fact, especially
when the second piece of code changes the value only <em>sometimes</em>.</p>
<p>In Rust the compiler guarantees that when we state that a value won’t change,
it really won’t change. That means that when you’re reading and writing code,
you don’t have to keep track of how and where a value might change, which can
make code easier to reason about.</p>
<p>But mutability can be very useful. Variables are immutable only by default; we
can make them mutable by adding <code>mut</code> in front of the variable name. In
addition to allowing this value to change, it conveys intent to future readers
of the code by indicating that other parts of the code will be changing this
variable value.</p>
<p>For example, change <em>src/main.rs</em> to the following:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {}&quot;, x);
    x = 6;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {}&quot;, x);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>When we run this program, we get the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30 secs
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x is: 5
The value of x is: 6
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>mut</code>, we’re allowed to change the value that <code>x</code> binds to from <code>5</code> to
<code>6</code>. In some cases, you’ll want to make a variable mutable because it makes the
code more convenient to write than an implementation that only uses immutable
variables.</p>
<p>There are multiple trade-offs to consider, in addition to the prevention of
bugs. For example, in cases where you’re using large data structures, mutating
an instance in place may be faster than copying and returning newly allocated
instances. With smaller data structures, creating new instances and writing in
a more functional programming style may be easier to reason about, so the lower
performance might be a worthwhile penalty for gaining that clarity.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#differences-between-variables-and-constants" id="differences-between-variables-and-constants"><h3>Differences Between Variables and Constants</h3></a>
<p>Being unable to change the value of a variable might have reminded you of
another programming concept that most other languages have: <em>constants</em>. Like
immutable variables, constants are also values  that are bound to a name and
are not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants
and variables.</p>
<p>First, we aren’t allowed to use <code>mut</code> with constants: constants aren’t only
immutable by default, they’re always immutable.</p>
<p>We declare constants using the <code>const</code> keyword instead of the <code>let</code> keyword,
and the type of the value <em>must</em> be annotated. We’re about to cover types and
type annotations in the next section, “Data Types,” so don’t worry about the
details right now, just know that we must always annotate the type.</p>
<p>Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes
them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.</p>
<p>The last difference is that constants may only be set to a constant expression,
not the result of a function call or any other value that could only be
computed at runtime.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a constant declaration where the constant’s name is
<code>MAX_POINTS</code> and its value is set to 100,000. (Rust constant naming convention
is to use all upper case with underscores between words):</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope they
were declared in, making them a useful choice for values in your application
domain that multiple parts of the program might need to know about, such as the
maximum number of points any player of a game is allowed to earn or the speed
of light.</p>
<p>Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in
conveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code. It also
helps to have only one place in your code you would need to change if the
hardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#shadowing" id="shadowing"><h3>Shadowing</h3></a>
<p>As we saw in the guessing game tutorial in Chapter 2, we can declare a new
variable with the same name as a previous variable, and the new variable
<em>shadows</em> the previous variable. Rustaceans say that the first variable is
<em>shadowed</em> by the second, which means that the second variable’s value is what
we’ll see when we use the variable. We can shadow a variable by using the same
variable’s name and repeating the use of the <code>let</code> keyword as follows:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    let x = x * 2;

    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {}&quot;, x);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This program first binds <code>x</code> to a value of <code>5</code>. Then it shadows <code>x</code> by
repeating <code>let x =</code>, taking the original value and adding <code>1</code> so the value of
<code>x</code> is then <code>6</code>. The third <code>let</code> statement also shadows <code>x</code>, taking the
previous value and multiplying it by <code>2</code> to give <code>x</code> a final value of <code>12</code>.
When you run this program, it will output the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31 secs
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x is: 12
</code></pre>
<p>This is different than marking a variable as <code>mut</code>, because unless we use the
<code>let</code> keyword again, we’ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to
reassign to this variable. We can perform a few transformations on a value but
have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.</p>
<p>The other difference between <code>mut</code> and shadowing is that because we’re
effectively creating a new variable when we use the <code>let</code> keyword again, we can
change the type of the value, but reuse the same name. For example, say our
program asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by
inputting space characters, but we really want to store that input as a number:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let spaces = &quot;   &quot;;
let spaces = spaces.len();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This construct is allowed because the first <code>spaces</code> variable is a string type,
and the second <code>spaces</code> variable, which is a brand-new variable that happens to
have the same name as the first one, is a number type. Shadowing thus spares us
from having to come up with different names, like <code>spaces_str</code> and
<code>spaces_num</code>; instead, we can reuse the simpler <code>spaces</code> name. However, if we
try to use <code>mut</code> for this, as shown here, we’ll get a compile-time error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut spaces = &quot;   &quot;;
spaces = spaces.len();
</code></pre>
<p>The error says we’re not allowed to mutate a variable’s type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --&gt; src/main.rs:3:14
  |
3 |     spaces = spaces.len();
  |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected &amp;str, found usize
  |
  = note: expected type `&amp;str`
             found type `usize`
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we’ve explored how variables work, let’s look at more data types they
can have.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#data-types" id="data-types"><h2>Data Types</h2></a>
<p>Every value in Rust is of a certain <em>type</em>, which tells Rust what kind of data
is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. In this section,
we’ll look at a number of types that are built into the language. We split the
types into two subsets: scalar and compound.</p>
<p>Throughout this section, keep in mind that Rust is a <em>statically typed</em>
language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile
time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the
value and how we use it. In cases when many types are possible, such as when we
converted a <code>String</code> to a numeric type using <code>parse</code> in Chapter 2, we must add
a type annotation, like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let guess: u32 = &quot;42&quot;.parse().expect(&quot;Not a number!&quot;);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If we don’t add the type annotation here, Rust will display the following
error, which means the compiler needs more information from us to know which
possible type we want to use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0282]: type annotations needed
 --&gt; src/main.rs:2:9
  |
2 |     let guess = &quot;42&quot;.parse().expect(&quot;Not a number!&quot;);
  |         ^^^^^
  |         |
  |         cannot infer type for `_`
  |         consider giving `guess` a type
</code></pre>
<p>You’ll see different type annotations as we discuss the various data types.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#scalar-types" id="scalar-types"><h3>Scalar Types</h3></a>
<p>A <em>scalar</em> type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types:
integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. You’ll likely
recognize these from other programming languages, but let’s jump into how they
work in Rust.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#integer-types" id="integer-types"><h4>Integer Types</h4></a>
<p>An <em>integer</em> is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer
type earlier in this chapter, the <code>u32</code> type. This type declaration indicates
that the value it’s associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed
integer types start with <code>i</code> instead of <code>u</code>) that takes up 32 bits of space.
Table 3-1 shows the built-in integer types in Rust. Each variant in the Signed
and Unsigned columns (for example, <em>i16</em>) can be used to declare the type of an
integer value.</p>
<p><span class="caption">Table 3-1: Integer Types in Rust</span></p>
<table><thead><tr><th> Length </th><th> Signed </th><th> Unsigned </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td> 8-bit  </td><td> i8     </td><td> u8       </td></tr>
<tr><td> 16-bit </td><td> i16    </td><td> u16      </td></tr>
<tr><td> 32-bit </td><td> i32    </td><td> u32      </td></tr>
<tr><td> 64-bit </td><td> i64    </td><td> u64      </td></tr>
<tr><td> arch   </td><td> isize  </td><td> usize    </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size.
Signed and unsigned refers to whether it’s possible for the number to be
negative or positive; in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign
with it (signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be
represented without a sign (unsigned). It’s like writing numbers on paper: when
the sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign; however,
when it’s safe to assume the number is positive, it’s shown with no sign.
Signed numbers are stored using two’s complement representation (if you’re
unsure what this is, you can search for it online; an explanation is outside
the scope of this book).</p>
<p>Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2<sup>n - 1</sup>) to 2<sup>n -
1</sup> - 1 inclusive, where <code>n</code> is the number of bits that variant uses. So an
<code>i8</code> can store numbers from -(2<sup>7</sup>) to 2<sup>7</sup> - 1, which equals
-128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup> - 1,
so a <code>u8</code> can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>8</sup> - 1, which equals 0 to 255.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>isize</code> and <code>usize</code> types depend on the kind of computer your
program is running on: 64-bits if you’re on a 64-bit architecture and 32-bits
if you’re on a 32-bit architecture.</p>
<p>You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in Table 3-2. Note
that all number literals except the byte literal allow a type suffix, such as
<code>57u8</code>, and <code>_</code> as a visual separator, such as <code>1_000</code>.</p>
<p><span class="caption">Table 3-2: Integer Literals in Rust</span></p>
<table><thead><tr><th> Number literals  </th><th> Example       </th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td> Decimal          </td><td> <code>98_222</code>      </td></tr>
<tr><td> Hex              </td><td> <code>0xff</code>        </td></tr>
<tr><td> Octal            </td><td> <code>0o77</code>        </td></tr>
<tr><td> Binary           </td><td> <code>0b1111_0000</code> </td></tr>
<tr><td> Byte (<code>u8</code> only) </td><td> <code>b'A'</code>        </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you’re unsure, Rust’s
defaults are generally good choices, and integer types default to <code>i32</code>: it’s
generally the fastest, even on 64-bit systems. The primary situation in which
you’d use <code>isize</code> or <code>usize</code> is when indexing some sort of collection.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#floating-point-types" id="floating-point-types"><h4>Floating-Point Types</h4></a>
<p>Rust also has two primitive types for <em>floating-point numbers</em>, which are
numbers with decimal points. Rust’s floating-point types are <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code>,
which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is <code>f64</code>
because on modern CPUs it’s roughly the same speed as <code>f32</code> but is capable of
more precision.</p>
<p>Here’s an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The
<code>f32</code> type is a single-precision float, and <code>f64</code> has double precision.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#numeric-operations" id="numeric-operations"><h4>Numeric Operations</h4></a>
<p>Rust supports the usual basic mathematical operations you’d expect for all of the
number types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder.
The following code shows how you’d use each one in a <code>let</code> statement:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Each expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and evaluates
to a single value, which is then bound to a variable. Appendix B contains a
list of all operators that Rust provides.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-boolean-type" id="the-boolean-type"><h4>The Boolean Type</h4></a>
<p>As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible
values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using <code>bool</code>.
For example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The main way to consume Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an <code>if</code>
expression. We’ll cover how <code>if</code> expressions work in Rust in the “Control Flow”
section.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-character-type" id="the-character-type"><h4>The Character Type</h4></a>
<p>So far we’ve only worked with numbers, but Rust supports letters too. Rust’s
<code>char</code> type is the language’s most primitive alphabetic type, and the following
code shows one way to use it. Note that the <code>char</code> type is specified with
single quotes, as opposed to strings that use double quotes:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
   let c = 'z';
   let z = 'ℤ';
   let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Rust’s <code>char</code> type represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can
represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters, Chinese/Japanese/Korean
ideographs, emoji, and zero width spaces are all valid <code>char</code> types in Rust.
Unicode Scalar Values range from <code>U+0000</code> to <code>U+D7FF</code> and <code>U+E000</code> to
<code>U+10FFFF</code> inclusive. However, a “character” isn’t really a concept in Unicode,
so your human intuition for what a “character” is may not match up with what a
<code>char</code> is in Rust. We’ll discuss this topic in detail in the “Strings” section
in Chapter 8.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#compound-types" id="compound-types"><h3>Compound Types</h3></a>
<p><em>Compound types</em> can group multiple values of other types into one type. Rust
has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#grouping-values-into-tuples" id="grouping-values-into-tuples"><h4>Grouping Values into Tuples</h4></a>
<p>A tuple is a general way of grouping together some number of other values with
a variety of types into one compound type.</p>
<p>We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside
parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the
different values in the tuple don’t have to be the same. We’ve added optional
type annotations in this example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The variable <code>tup</code> binds to the entire tuple, since a tuple is considered a
single compound element. To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can
use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!(&quot;The value of y is: {}&quot;, y);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable <code>tup</code>. It then
uses a pattern with <code>let</code> to take <code>tup</code> and turn it into three separate
variables, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>. This is called <em>destructuring</em>, because it breaks
the single tuple into three parts. Finally, the program prints the value of
<code>y</code>, which is <code>6.4</code>.</p>
<p>In addition to destructuring through pattern matching, we can also access a
tuple element directly by using a period (<code>.</code>) followed by the index of the
value we want to access. For example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This program creates a tuple, <code>x</code>, and then makes new variables for each
element by using their index. As with most programming languages, the first
index in a tuple is 0.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#arrays" id="arrays"><h4>Arrays</h4></a>
<p>Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an <em>array</em>. Unlike
a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Arrays in Rust are
different than arrays in some other languages because arrays in Rust have a
fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.</p>
<p>In Rust, the values going into an array are written as a comma-separated list
inside square brackets:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than
the heap (we will discuss the stack and the heap more in Chapter 4), or when
you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements. They aren’t as
flexible as the vector type, though. The vector type is a similar collection
type provided by the standard library that <em>is</em> allowed to grow or shrink in
size. If you’re unsure whether to use an array or a vector, you should probably
use a vector: Chapter 8 discusses vectors in more detail.</p>
<p>An example of when you might want to use an array rather than a vector is in a
program that needs to know the names of the months of the year. It’s very
unlikely that such a program will need to add or remove months, so you can use
an array because you know it will always contain 12 items:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let months = [&quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;, &quot;April&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;June&quot;, &quot;July&quot;,
              &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;, &quot;October&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;December&quot;];
#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#accessing-array-elements" id="accessing-array-elements"><h5>Accessing Array Elements</h5></a>
<p>An array is a single chunk of memory allocated on the stack. We can access
elements of an array using indexing, like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, the variable named <code>first</code> will get the value <code>1</code>, because
that is the value at index <code>[0]</code> in the array. The variable named <code>second</code> will
get the value <code>2</code> from index <code>[1]</code> in the array.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#invalid-array-element-access" id="invalid-array-element-access"><h5>Invalid Array Element Access</h5></a>
<p>What happens if you try to access an element of an array that is past the end
of the array? Say you change the example to the following code, which will
compile but exit with an error when it runs:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let index = 10;

    let element = a[index];

    println!(&quot;The value of element is: {}&quot;, element);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Running this code using <code>cargo run</code> produces the following result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling arrays v0.1.0 (file:///projects/arrays)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31 secs

 10', src/main.rs:6
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
</code></pre>
<p>The compilation didn’t produce any errors, but the program results in a
<em>runtime</em> error and didn’t exit successfully. When you attempt to access an
element using indexing, Rust will check that the index you’ve specified is less
than the array length. If the index is greater than the length, Rust will
<em>panic</em>, which is the term Rust uses when a program exits with an error.</p>
<p>This is the first example of Rust’s safety principles in action. In many
low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an
incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this
kind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and
continuing. Chapter 9 discusses more of Rust’s error handling.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#how-functions-work" id="how-functions-work"><h2>How Functions Work</h2></a>
<p>Functions are pervasive in Rust code. You’ve already seen one of the most
important functions in the language: the <code>main</code> function, which is the entry
point of many programs. You’ve also seen the <code>fn</code> keyword, which allows you to
declare new functions.</p>
<p>Rust code uses <em>snake case</em> as the conventional style for function and variable
names. In snake case, all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words.
Here’s a program that contains an example function definition:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!(&quot;Another function.&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Function definitions in Rust start with <code>fn</code> and have a set of parentheses
after the function name. The curly brackets tell the compiler where the
function body begins and ends.</p>
<p>We can call any function we’ve defined by entering its name followed by a set
of parentheses. Because <code>another_function</code> is defined in the program, it can be
called from inside the <code>main</code> function. Note that we defined <code>another_function</code>
<em>after</em> the <code>main</code> function in the source code; we could have defined it before
as well. Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re
defined somewhere.</p>
<p>Let’s start a new binary project named <em>functions</em> to explore functions
further. Place the <code>another_function</code> example in <em>src/main.rs</em> and run it. You
should see the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.28 secs
     Running `target/debug/functions`
Hello, world!
Another function.
</code></pre>
<p>The lines execute in the order in which they appear in the <code>main</code> function.
First, the “Hello, world!” message prints, and then <code>another_function</code> is
called and its message is printed.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#function-parameters" id="function-parameters"><h3>Function Parameters</h3></a>
<p>Functions can also be defined to have <em>parameters</em>, which are special variables
that are part of a function’s signature. When a function has parameters, we can
provide it with concrete values for those parameters. Technically, the concrete
values are called <em>arguments</em>, but in casual conversation people tend to use
the words “parameter” and “argument” interchangeably for either the variables
in a function’s definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a
function.</p>
<p>The following rewritten version of <code>another_function</code> shows what parameters
look like in Rust:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {}&quot;, x);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Try running this program; you should get the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.21 secs
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The value of x is: 5
</code></pre>
<p>The declaration of <code>another_function</code> has one parameter named <code>x</code>. The type of
<code>x</code> is specified as <code>i32</code>. When <code>5</code> is passed to <code>another_function</code>, the
<code>println!</code> macro puts <code>5</code> where the pair of curly brackets were in the format
string.</p>
<p>In function signatures, you <em>must</em> declare the type of each parameter. This is
a deliberate decision in Rust’s design: requiring type annotations in function
definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in
the code to figure out what you mean.</p>
<p>When you want a function to have multiple parameters, separate the parameter
declarations with commas, like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    another_function(5, 6);
}

fn another_function(x: i32, y: i32) {
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {}&quot;, x);
    println!(&quot;The value of y is: {}&quot;, y);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This example creates a function with two parameters, both of which are <code>i32</code>
types. The function then prints out the values in both of its parameters. Note
that function parameters don’t all need to be the same type, they just happen
to be in this example.</p>
<p>Let’s try running this code. Replace the program currently in your <em>functions</em>
project’s <em>src/main.rs</em> file with the preceding example, and run it using
<code>cargo run</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31 secs
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The value of x is: 5
The value of y is: 6
</code></pre>
<p>Because we called the function with <code>5</code> as the value for  <code>x</code> and <code>6</code> is passed
as the value for <code>y</code>, the two strings are printed with these values.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#function-bodies" id="function-bodies"><h3>Function Bodies</h3></a>
<p>Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an
expression. So far, we’ve only covered functions without an ending expression,
but we have seen expressions as parts of statements. Because Rust is an
expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand.
Other languages don’t have the same distinctions, so let’s look at what
statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the bodies of
functions.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#statements-and-expressions" id="statements-and-expressions"><h3>Statements and Expressions</h3></a>
<p>We’ve actually already used statements and expressions. <em>Statements</em> are
instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. <em>Expressions</em>
evaluate to a resulting value. Let’s look at some examples.</p>
<p>Creating a variable and assigning a value to it with the <code>let</code> keyword is a
statement. In Listing 3-1, <code>let y = 6;</code> is a statement:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 3-1: A <code>main</code> function declaration containing one statement.</span></p>
<p>Function definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example is a
statement in itself.</p>
<p>Statements do not return values. Therefore, you can’t assign a <code>let</code> statement
to another variable, as the following code tries to do; you’ll get an error:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6);
}
</code></pre>
<p>When you run this program, the error you’ll get looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
error: expected expression, found statement (`let`)
 --&gt; src/main.rs:2:14
  |
2 |     let x = (let y = 6);
  |              ^^^
  |
  = note: variable declaration using `let` is a statement
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>let y = 6</code> statement does not return a value, so there isn’t anything for
<code>x</code> to bind to. This is different than in other languages, such as C and Ruby,
where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In those languages,
you can write <code>x = y = 6</code> and have both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have the value <code>6</code>; that is
not the case in Rust.</p>
<p>Expressions evaluate to something and make up most of the rest of the code that
you’ll write in Rust. Consider a simple math operation, such as <code>5 + 6</code>, which
is an expression that evaluates to the value <code>11</code>. Expressions can be part of
statements: in Listing 3-1 that had the statement <code>let y = 6;</code>, <code>6</code> is an
expression that evaluates to the value <code>6</code>. Calling a function is an
expression. Calling a macro is an expression. The block that we use to create
new scopes, <code>{}</code>, is an expression, for example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!(&quot;The value of y is: {}&quot;, y);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">{
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>is a block that, in this case, evaluates to <code>4</code>. That value gets bound to <code>y</code>
as part of the <code>let</code> statement. Note the <code>x + 1</code> line without a semicolon at
the end, unlike most of the lines you’ve seen so far. Expressions do not
include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression,
you turn it into a statement, which will then not return a value. Keep this in
mind as you explore function return values and expressions next.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#functions-with-return-values" id="functions-with-return-values"><h3>Functions with Return Values</h3></a>
<p>Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don’t name return
values, but we do declare their type after an arrow (<code>-&gt;</code>). In Rust, the return
value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in
the block of the body of a function. You can return early from a function by
using the <code>return</code> keyword and specifying a value, but most functions return
the last expression implicitly. Here’s an example of a function that returns a
value:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn five() -&gt; i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {}&quot;, x);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>There are no function calls, macros, or even <code>let</code> statements in the <code>five</code>
function—just the number <code>5</code> by itself. That’s a perfectly valid function in
Rust. Note that the function’s return type is specified, too, as <code>-&gt; i32</code>. Try
running this code; the output should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30 secs
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The value of x is: 5
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>5</code> in <code>five</code> is the function’s return value, which is why the return type
is <code>i32</code>. Let’s examine this in more detail. There are two important bits:
first, the line <code>let x = five();</code> shows that we’re using the return value of a
function to initialize a variable. Because the function <code>five</code> returns a <code>5</code>,
that line is the same as the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let x = 5;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Second, the <code>five</code> function has no parameters and defines the type of the
return value, but the body of the function is a lonely <code>5</code> with no semicolon
because it’s an expression whose value we want to return. Let’s look at another
example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {}&quot;, x);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    x + 1
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Running this code will print <code>The value of x is: 6</code>. What happens if we place a
semicolon at the end of the line containing <code>x + 1</code>, changing it from an
expression to a statement? We’ll get an error:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {}&quot;, x);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    x + 1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Running this code produces an error, as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --&gt; src/main.rs:7:28
  |
7 |   fn plus_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {

9 | | }
  | |_^ expected i32, found ()
  |
  = note: expected type `i32`
             found type `()`
</code></pre>
<p>The main error message, “mismatched types,” reveals the core issue with this
code. The definition of the function <code>plus_one</code> says that it will return an
<code>i32</code>, but statements don’t evaluate to a value, which is expressed by <code>()</code>,
the empty tuple. Therefore, nothing is returned, which contradicts the function
definition and results in an error. In this output, Rust provides a message to
possibly help rectify this issue: it suggests removing the semicolon, which
would fix the error.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#comments" id="comments"><h2>Comments</h2></a>
<p>All programmers strive to make their code easy to understand, but sometimes
extra explanation is warranted. In these cases, programmers leave notes, or
<em>comments</em>, in their source code that the compiler will ignore but people
reading the source code may find useful.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple comment:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// Hello, world.
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In Rust, comments must start with two slashes and continue until the end of the
line. For comments that extend beyond a single line, you’ll need to include
<code>//</code> on each line, like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// So we’re doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
// multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
// explain what’s going on.
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Comments can also be placed at the end of lines containing code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let lucky_number = 7; // I’m feeling lucky today.
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>But you’ll more often see them used in this format, with the comment on a
separate line above the code it’s annotating:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    // I’m feeling lucky today.
    let lucky_number = 7;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Rust also has another kind of comment, documentation comments, which we’ll
discuss in Chapter 14.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#control-flow" id="control-flow"><h2>Control Flow</h2></a>
<p>Deciding whether or not to run some code depending on if a condition is true or
deciding to run some code repeatedly while a condition is true are basic
building blocks in most programming languages. The most common constructs that
let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are <code>if</code> expressions and
loops.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#if-expressions" id="if-expressions"><h3><code>if</code> Expressions</h3></a>
<p>An <code>if</code> expression allows us to branch our code depending on conditions. We
provide a condition and then state, “If this condition is met, run this block
of code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code.”</p>
<p>Create a new project called <em>branches</em> in your <em>projects</em> directory to explore
the <code>if</code> expression. In the <em>src/main.rs</em> file, input the following:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number &lt; 5 {
        println!(&quot;condition was true&quot;);
    } else {
        println!(&quot;condition was false&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<!-- NEXT PARAGRAPH WRAPPED WEIRD INTENTIONALLY SEE #199 -->
<p>All <code>if</code> expressions start with the keyword <code>if</code>, which is followed by a
condition. In this case, the condition checks whether or not the variable
<code>number</code> has a value less than 5. The block of code we want to execute if the
condition is true is placed immediately after the condition inside curly
brackets. Blocks of code associated with the conditions in <code>if</code> expressions are
sometimes called <em>arms</em>, just like the arms in <code>match</code> expressions that we
discussed in the “Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number” section of
Chapter 2. Optionally, we can also include an <code>else</code> expression, which we chose
to do here, to give the program an alternative block of code to execute should
the condition evaluate to false. If you don’t provide an <code>else</code> expression and
the condition is false, the program will just skip the <code>if</code> block and move on
to the next bit of code.</p>
<p>Try running this code; you should see the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run

</code></pre>
<p>Let’s try changing the value of <code>number</code> to a value that makes the condition
<code>false</code> to see what happens:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let number = 7;
</code></pre>
<p>Run the program again, and look at the output:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the condition in this code <em>must</em> be a <code>bool</code>. If
the condition isn’t a <code>bool</code>, we’ll get an error. For example, try running the
following code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number {
        println!(&quot;number was three&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>if</code> condition evaluates to a value of <code>3</code> this time, and Rust throws an
error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0308]: mismatched types

  |
  = note: expected type `bool`
             found type `{integer}`
</code></pre>
<p>The error indicates that Rust expected a <code>bool</code> but got an integer. Rust will
not automatically try to convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean, unlike
languages such as Ruby and JavaScript. You must be explicit and always provide
<code>if</code> with a Boolean as its condition. If we want the <code>if</code> code block to run
only when a number is not equal to <code>0</code>, for example, we can change the <code>if</code>
expression to the following:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number != 0 {
        println!(&quot;number was something other than zero&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Running this code will print <code>number was something other than zero</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#multiple-conditions-with-else-if" id="multiple-conditions-with-else-if"><h4>Multiple Conditions with <code>else if</code></h4></a>
<p>We can have multiple conditions by combining <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> in an <code>else if</code>
expression. For example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!(&quot;number is divisible by 4&quot;);
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!(&quot;number is divisible by 3&quot;);
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!(&quot;number is divisible by 2&quot;);
    } else {
        println!(&quot;number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2&quot;);
    }
}

<p>This program has four possible paths it can take. After running it, you should
see the following output:</p>

number is divisible by 3
</code></pre>
<p>When this program executes, it checks each <code>if</code> expression in turn and executes
the first body for which the condition holds true. Note that even though 6 is
divisible by 2, we don’t see the output <code>number is divisible by 2</code>, nor do we
see the <code>number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2</code> text from the <code>else</code> block. The
reason is that Rust will only execute the block for the first true condition,
and once it finds one, it won’t even check the rest.</p>
<p>Using too many <code>else if</code> expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more
than one, you might want to refactor your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful
Rust branching construct called <code>match</code> for these cases.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-if-in-a-let-statement" id="using-if-in-a-let-statement"><h4>Using <code>if</code> in a <code>let</code> statement</h4></a>
<p>Because <code>if</code> is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a <code>let</code>
statement, for instance in Listing 3-2:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition {

<p><span class="caption">Listing 3-2: Assigning the result of an <code>if</code> expression

</code></pre>
<p>Remember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them, and
numbers by themselves are also expressions. In this case, the value of the
whole <code>if</code> expression depends on which block of code executes. This means the
values that have the potential to be results from each arm of the <code>if</code> must be
the same type; in Listing 3-2, the results of both the <code>if</code> arm and the <code>else</code>
arm were <code>i32</code> integers. If the types are mismatched, as in the following
example, we’ll get an error:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    } else {
        &quot;six&quot;
    };

    println!(&quot;The value of number is: {}&quot;, number);
}
</code></pre>
<p>When we try to run this code, we’ll get an error. The <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> arms have
value types that are incompatible, and Rust indicates exactly where to find the
problem in the program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0308]: if and else have incompatible types

  = note: expected type `{integer}`
             found type `&amp;str`
</code></pre>
<p>The expression in the <code>if</code> block evaluates to an integer, and the expression in
the <code>else</code> block evaluates to a string. This won’t work because variables must
have a single type. Rust needs to know at compile time what type the <code>number</code>
variable is, definitively, so it can verify at compile time that its type is
valid everywhere we use <code>number</code>. Rust wouldn’t be able to do that if the type
of <code>number</code> was only determined at runtime; the compiler would be more complex
and would make fewer guarantees about the code if it had to keep track of
multiple hypothetical types for any variable.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#repetition-with-loops" id="repetition-with-loops"><h3>Repetition with Loops</h3></a>
<p>It’s often useful to execute a block of code more than once. For this task,
Rust provides several <em>loops</em>. A loop runs through the code inside the loop
body to the end and then starts immediately back at the beginning. To
experiment with loops, let’s make a new project called <em>loops</em>.</p>
<p>Rust has three kinds of loops: <code>loop</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>for</code>. Let’s try each one.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#repeating-code-with-loop" id="repeating-code-with-loop"><h4>Repeating Code with <code>loop</code></h4></a>
<p>The <code>loop</code> keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again
forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.</p>
<p>As an example, change the <em>src/main.rs</em> file in your <em>loops</em> directory to look
like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    loop {
        println!(&quot;again!&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When we run this program, we’ll see <code>again!</code> printed over and over continuously
until we stop the program manually. Most terminals support a keyboard shortcut,
<span class="keystroke">ctrl-C</span>, to halt a program that is stuck in a
continual loop. Give it a try:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.29 secs
     Running `target/debug/loops`
again!
again!
again!
again!
^Cagain!
</code></pre>
<p>The symbol <code>^C</code> represents where you pressed <span class="keystroke">ctrl-C
</span>. You may or may not see the word <code>again!</code> printed after the <code>^C</code>,
depending on where the code was in the loop when it received the halt signal.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Rust provides another, more reliable way to break out of a loop.
You can place the <code>break</code> keyword within the loop to tell the program when to
stop executing the loop. Recall that we did this in the guessing game in the
“Quitting After a Correct Guess” section of Chapter 2 to exit the
program when the user won the game by guessing the correct number.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#conditional-loops-with-while" id="conditional-loops-with-while"><h4>Conditional Loops with <code>while</code></h4></a>
<p>It’s often useful for a program to evaluate a condition within a loop. While
the condition is true, the loop runs. When the condition ceases to be true, you
call <code>break</code>, stopping the loop. This loop type could be implemented using a
combination of <code>loop</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>break</code>; you could try that now in a
program, if you’d like.</p>
<p>However, this pattern is so common that Rust has a built-in language construct
for it, and it’s called a <code>while</code> loop. The following example uses <code>while</code>: the
program loops three times, counting down each time. Then, after the loop, it
prints another message and exits:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!(&quot;{}!&quot;, number);

        number = number - 1;
    }

    println!(&quot;LIFTOFF!!!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if you used
<code>loop</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>break</code>, and it’s clearer. While a condition holds
true, the code runs; otherwise, it exits the loop.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#looping-through-a-collection-with-for" id="looping-through-a-collection-with-for"><h4>Looping Through a Collection with <code>for</code></h4></a>
<p>You could use the <code>while</code> construct to loop over the elements of a collection,
such as an array. For example, let’s look at Listing 3-3:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index &lt; 5 {
        println!(&quot;the value is: {}&quot;, a[index]);

        index = index + 1;
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 3-3: Looping through each element of a collection
using a <code>while</code> loop</span></p>
<p>Here, the code counts up through the elements in the array. It starts at index
<code>0</code>, and then loops until it reaches the final index in the array (that is,
when <code>index &lt; 5</code> is no longer true). Running this code will print out every
element in the array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs
     Running `target/debug/loops`
the value is: 10
the value is: 20
the value is: 30
the value is: 40
the value is: 50
</code></pre>
<p>All five array values appear in the terminal, as expected. Even though <code>index</code>
will reach a value of <code>5</code> at some point, the loop stops executing before trying
to fetch a sixth value from the array.</p>
<p>But this approach is error prone; we could cause the program to panic if the
index length is incorrect. It’s also slow, because the compiler adds runtime
code to perform the conditional check on every element on every iteration
through the loop.</p>
<p>As a more concise alternative, you can use a <code>for</code> loop and execute some code
for each item in a collection. A <code>for</code> loop looks like this code in Listing 3-4:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a.iter() {
        println!(&quot;the value is: {}&quot;, element);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 3-4: Looping through each element of a collection
using a <code>for</code> loop</span></p>
<p>When we run this code, we’ll see the same output as in Listing 3-3. More
importantly, we’ve now increased the safety of the code and eliminated the
chance of bugs that might result from going beyond the end of the array or not
going far enough and missing some items.</p>
<p>For example, in the code in Listing 3-3, if you removed an item from the <code>a</code>
array but forgot to update the condition to <code>while index &lt; 4</code>, the code would
panic. Using the <code>for</code> loop, you don’t need to remember to change any other
code if you changed the number of values in the array.</p>
<p>The safety and conciseness of <code>for</code> loops make them the most commonly used loop
construct in Rust. Even in situations in which you want to run some code a
certain number of times, as in the countdown example that used a <code>while</code> loop
in Listing 3-3, most Rustaceans would use a <code>for</code> loop. The way to do that
would be to use a <code>Range</code>, which is a type provided by the standard library
that generates all numbers in sequence starting from one number and ending
before another number.</p>
<p>Here’s what the countdown would look like using a <code>for</code> loop and another method
we’ve not yet talked about, <code>rev</code>, to reverse the range:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!(&quot;{}!&quot;, number);
    }
    println!(&quot;LIFTOFF!!!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code is a bit nicer, isn’t it?</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#summary-1" id="summary-1"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>You made it! That was a sizable chapter: you learned about variables, scalar
and <code>if</code> expressions, and loops! If you want to practice with the concepts
discussed in this chapter, try building programs to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.</li>
<li>Generate the nth Fibonacci number.</li>
<li>Print the lyrics to the Christmas carol “The Twelve Days of Christmas,”
taking advantage of the repetition in the song.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you’re ready to move on, we’ll talk about a concept in Rust that <em>doesn’t</em>
commonly exist in other programming languages: ownership.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#understanding-ownership" id="understanding-ownership"><h1>Understanding Ownership</h1></a>
<p>Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature, and it enables Rust to make memory
safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector. Therefore, it’s
important to understand how ownership works in Rust. In this chapter we’ll talk
about ownership as well as several related features: borrowing, slices, and how
Rust lays data out in memory.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#what-is-ownership" id="what-is-ownership"><h2>What Is Ownership?</h2></a>
<p>Rust’s central feature is <em>ownership</em>. Although the feature is straightforward
to explain, it has deep implications for the rest of the language.</p>
<p>All programs have to manage the way they use a computer’s memory while running.
Some languages have garbage collection that constantly looks for no longer used
memory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer must explicitly
allocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed
through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at
compile time. No run-time costs are incurred for any of the ownership features.</p>
<p>Because ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some time
to get used to. The good news is that the more experienced you become with Rust
and the rules of the ownership system, the more you’ll be able to naturally
develop code that is safe and efficient. Keep at it!</p>
<p>When you understand ownership, you’ll have a solid foundation for understanding
the features that make Rust unique. In this chapter, you’ll learn ownership by
working through some examples that focus on a very common data structure:
strings.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#the-stack-and-the-heap" id="the-stack-and-the-heap"><h3>The Stack and the Heap</h3></a>
<p>In many programming languages, we don’t have to think about the stack and the
heap very often. But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a
value is on the stack or the heap has more of an effect on how the language
behaves and why we have to make certain decisions. We’ll describe parts of
ownership in relation to the stack and the heap later in this chapter, so here
is a brief explanation in preparation.</p>
<p>Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory that is available to your code
to use at runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores
values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order.
This is referred to as <em>last in, first out</em>. Think of a stack of plates: when
you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when you need a
plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates from the middle or
bottom wouldn’t work as well! Adding data is called <em>pushing onto the stack</em>,
and removing data is called <em>popping off the stack</em>.</p>
<p>The stack is fast because of the way it accesses the data: it never has to
search for a place to put new data or a place to get data from because that
place is always the top. Another property that makes the stack fast is that
all data on the stack must take up a known, fixed size.</p>
<p>For data with a size unknown to us at compile time or a size that might
change, we can store data on the heap instead. The heap is less organized:
when we put data on the heap, we ask for some amount of space. The operating
system finds an empty spot somewhere in the heap that is big enough, marks it
as being in use, and returns to us a <em>pointer</em>, which is the address of that
location. This process is called <em>allocating on the heap</em>, and sometimes we
abbreviate the phrase as just “allocating.” Pushing values onto the stack is
not considered allocating. Because the pointer is a known, fixed size, we can
store the pointer on the stack, but when we want the actual data, we have to
follow the pointer.</p>
<p>Think of being seated at a restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of
people in your group, and the staff finds an empty table that fits everyone
and leads you there. If someone in your group comes late, they can ask where
you’ve been seated to find you.</p>
<p>Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because
we have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are faster
if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server
at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get
all the orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an
order from table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and
then one from B again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a
processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other
data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the
heap). Allocating a large amount of space on the heap can also take time.</p>
<p>When our code calls a function, the values passed into the function
(including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s
local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those
values get popped off the stack.</p>
<p>Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap,
minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused
data on the heap so we don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership
addresses. Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to think about the
stack and the heap very often, but knowing that managing heap data is why
ownership exists can help explain why it works the way it does.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#ownership-rules" id="ownership-rules"><h3>Ownership Rules</h3></a>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as we
work through the examples that illustrate the rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its <em>owner</em>.</li>
<li>There can only be one owner at a time.</li>
<li>When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#variable-scope" id="variable-scope"><h3>Variable Scope</h3></a>
<p>We’ve walked through an example of a Rust program already in Chapter 2. Now
that we’re past basic syntax, we won’t include all the <code>fn main() {</code> code in
examples, so if you’re following along, you’ll have to put the following
examples inside a <code>main</code> function manually. As a result, our examples will be a
bit more concise, letting us focus on the actual details rather than
boilerplate code.</p>
<p>As a first example of ownership, we’ll look at the <em>scope</em> of some variables. A
scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid. Let’s say we
have a variable that looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let s = &quot;hello&quot;;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The variable <code>s</code> refers to a string literal, where the value of the string is
hardcoded into the text of our program. The variable is valid from the point at
which it’s declared until the end of the current <em>scope</em>. Listing 4-1 has
comments annotating where the variable <code>s</code> is valid:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
{                      // s is not valid here, it’s not yet declared
    let s = &quot;hello&quot;;   // s is valid from this point forward

    // do stuff with s
}                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-1: A variable and the scope in which it is
valid</span></p>
<p>In other words, there are two important points in time here:</p>
<ol>
<li>When <code>s</code> comes <em>into scope</em>, it is valid.</li>
<li>It remains so until it goes <em>out of scope</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, the relationship between scopes and when variables are valid is
similar to other programming languages. Now we’ll build on top of this
understanding by introducing the <code>String</code> type.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-string-type" id="the-string-type"><h3>The <code>String</code> Type</h3></a>
<p>To illustrate the rules of ownership, we need a data type that is more complex
than the ones we covered in Chapter 3. The types covered in the “Data Types”
section are all stored on the stack and popped off the stack when their scope
is over, but we want to look at data that is stored on the heap and explore how
Rust knows when to clean up that data.</p>
<p>We’ll use <code>String</code> as the example here and concentrate on the parts of <code>String</code>
that relate to ownership. These aspects also apply to other complex data types
provided by the standard library and that you create. We’ll discuss <code>String</code> in
more depth in Chapter 8.</p>
<p>We’ve already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into our
program. String literals are convenient, but they aren’t always suitable for
every situation in which you want to use text. One reason is that they’re
immutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write
our code: for example, what if we want to take user input and store it? For
these situations, Rust has a second string type, <code>String</code>. This type is
allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is
unknown to us at compile time. You can create a <code>String</code> from a string literal
using the <code>from</code> function, like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The double colon (<code>::</code>) is an operator that allows us to namespace this
particular <code>from</code> function under the <code>String</code> type rather than using some sort
of name like <code>string_from</code>. We’ll discuss this syntax more in the “Method
Syntax” section of Chapter 5 and when we talk about namespacing with modules in
Chapter 7.</p>
<p>This kind of string <em>can</em> be mutated:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

s.push_str(&quot;, world!&quot;); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

println!(&quot;{}&quot;, s); // This will print `hello, world!`
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>So, what’s the difference here? Why can <code>String</code> be mutated but literals
cannot? The difference is how these two types deal with memory.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#memory-and-allocation" id="memory-and-allocation"><h3>Memory and Allocation</h3></a>
<p>In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time so the
text is hardcoded directly into the final executable, making string literals
fast and efficient. But these properties only come from its immutability.
Unfortunately, we can’t put a blob of memory into the binary for each piece of
text whose size is unknown at compile time and whose size might change while
running the program.</p>
<p>With the <code>String</code> type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text,
we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time,
to hold the contents. This means:</p>
<ol>
<li>The memory must be requested from the operating system at runtime.</li>
<li>We need a way of returning this memory to the operating system when we’re
done with our <code>String</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That first part is done by us: when we call <code>String::from</code>, its implementation
requests the memory it needs. This is pretty much universal in programming
languages.</p>
<p>However, the second part is different. In languages with a <em>garbage collector
(GC)</em>, the GC keeps track and cleans up memory that isn’t being used anymore,
and we, as the programmer, don’t need to think about it. Without a GC, it’s the
programmer’s responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and
call code to explicitly return it, just as we did to request it. Doing this
correctly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget,
we’ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we’ll have an invalid variable. If
we do it twice, that’s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one <code>allocate</code> with
exactly one <code>free</code>.</p>
<p>Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the
variable that owns it goes out of scope. Here’s a version of our scope example
from Listing 4-1 using a <code>String</code> instead of a string literal:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
{
    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;); // s is valid from this point forward

    // do stuff with s
}                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no
                                   // longer valid
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our <code>String</code> needs
to the operating system: when <code>s</code> goes out of scope. When a variable goes out
of scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called <code>drop</code>,
and it’s where the author of <code>String</code> can put the code to return the memory.
Rust calls <code>drop</code> automatically at the closing <code>}</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item’s
lifetime is sometimes called <em>Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)</em>.
The <code>drop</code> function in Rust will be familiar to you if you’ve used RAII
patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pattern has a profound impact on the way Rust code is written. It may seem
simple right now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected in more
complicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use the data
we’ve allocated on the heap. Let’s explore some of those situations now.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#ways-variables-and-data-interact-move" id="ways-variables-and-data-interact-move"><h4>Ways Variables and Data Interact: Move</h4></a>
<p>Multiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust.
Let’s look at an example using an integer in Listing 4-2:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let x = 5;
let y = x;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-2: Assigning the integer value of variable <code>x</code>
to <code>y</code></span></p>
<p>We can probably guess what this is doing based on our experience with other
languages: “Bind the value <code>5</code> to <code>x</code>; then make a copy of the value in <code>x</code> and
bind it to <code>y</code>.” We now have two variables, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and both equal <code>5</code>.
This is indeed what is happening because integers are simple values with a
known, fixed size, and these two <code>5</code> values are pushed onto the stack.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the <code>String</code> version:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
let s2 = s1;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This looks very similar to the previous code, so we might assume that the way
it works would be the same: that is, the second line would make a copy of the
value in <code>s1</code> and bind it to <code>s2</code>. But this isn’t quite what happens.</p>
<p>To explain this more thoroughly, let’s look at what <code>String</code> looks like under
the covers in Figure 4-1. A <code>String</code> is made up of three parts, shown on the
left: a pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length,
and a capacity. This group of data is stored on the stack. On the right is the
memory on the heap that holds the contents.</p>
<p><img alt="String in memory" src="img/trpl04-01.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-1: Representation in memory of a <code>String</code>
holding the value <code>&quot;hello&quot;</code> bound to <code>s1</code></span></p>
<p>The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the <code>String</code> is
currently using. The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the
<code>String</code> has received from the operating system. The difference between length
and capacity matters, but not in this context, so for now, it’s fine to ignore
the capacity.</p>
<p>When we assign <code>s1</code> to <code>s2</code>, the <code>String</code> data is copied, meaning we copy the
pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the
data on the heap that the pointer refers to. In other words, the data
representation in memory looks like Figure 4-2.</p>
<p><img alt="s1 and s2 pointing to the same value" src="img/trpl04-02.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-2: Representation in memory of the variable <code>s2</code>
that has a copy of the pointer, length, and capacity of <code>s1</code></span></p>
<p>The representation does <em>not</em> look like Figure 4-3, which is what memory would
look like if Rust instead copied the heap data as well. If Rust did this, the
operation <code>s2 = s1</code> could potentially be very expensive in terms of runtime
performance if the data on the heap was large.</p>
<p><img alt="s1 and s2 to two places" src="img/trpl04-03.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-3: Another possibility of what <code>s2 = s1</code> might
do if Rust copied the heap data as well</span></p>
<p>Earlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically
calls the <code>drop</code> function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable. But
Figure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a
problem: when <code>s2</code> and <code>s1</code> go out of scope, they will both try to free the
same memory. This is known as a <em>double free</em> error and is one of the memory
safety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory
corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>To ensure memory safety, there’s one more detail to what happens in this
situation in Rust. Instead of trying to copy the allocated memory, Rust
considers <code>s1</code> to no longer be valid and therefore, Rust doesn’t need to free
anything when <code>s1</code> goes out of scope. Check out what happens when you try to
use <code>s1</code> after <code>s2</code> is created, it won’t work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
let s2 = s1;

println!(&quot;{}, world!&quot;, s1);
</code></pre>
<p>You’ll get an error like this because Rust prevents you from using the
invalidated reference:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0382]: use of moved value: `s1`
 --&gt; src/main.rs:5:28
  |
3 |     let s2 = s1;
  |         -- value moved here
4 |
5 |     println!(&quot;{}, world!&quot;, s1);
  |                            ^^ value used here after move
  |
  = note: move occurs because `s1` has type `std::string::String`, which does
  not implement the `Copy` trait
</code></pre>
<p>If you’ve heard the terms “shallow copy” and “deep copy” while working with
other languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity
without copying the data probably sounds like a shallow copy. But because Rust
also invalidates the first variable, instead of calling this a shallow copy,
it’s known as a <em>move</em>. Here we would read this by saying that <code>s1</code> was <em>moved</em>
into <code>s2</code>. So what actually happens is shown in Figure 4-4.</p>
<p><img alt="s1 moved to s2" src="img/trpl04-04.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-4: Representation in memory after <code>s1</code> has been
invalidated</span></p>
<p>That solves our problem! With only <code>s2</code> valid, when it goes out of scope, it
alone will free the memory, and we’re done.</p>
<p>In addition, there’s a design choice that’s implied by this: Rust will never
automatically create “deep” copies of your data. Therefore, any <em>automatic</em>
copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#ways-variables-and-data-interact-clone" id="ways-variables-and-data-interact-clone"><h4>Ways Variables and Data Interact: Clone</h4></a>
<p>If we <em>do</em> want to deeply copy the heap data of the <code>String</code>, not just the
stack data, we can use a common method called <code>clone</code>. We’ll discuss method
syntax in Chapter 5, but because methods are a common feature in many
programming languages, you’ve probably seen them before.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the <code>clone</code> method in action:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!(&quot;s1 = {}, s2 = {}&quot;, s1, s2);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This works just fine and is how you can explicitly produce the behavior shown
in Figure 4-3, where the heap data <em>does</em> get copied.</p>
<p>When you see a call to <code>clone</code>, you know that some arbitrary code is being
executed and that code may be expensive. It’s a visual indicator that something
different is going on.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#stack-only-data-copy" id="stack-only-data-copy"><h4>Stack-Only Data: Copy</h4></a>
<p>There’s another wrinkle we haven’t talked about yet. This code using integers,
part of which was shown earlier in Listing 4-2, works and is valid:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let x = 5;
let y = x;

println!(&quot;x = {}, y = {}&quot;, x, y);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don’t have a call to
<code>clone</code>, but <code>x</code> is still valid and wasn’t moved into <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>The reason is that types like integers that have a known size at compile time
are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to
make. That means there’s no reason we would want to prevent <code>x</code> from being
valid after we create the variable <code>y</code>. In other words, there’s no difference
between deep and shallow copying here, so calling <code>clone</code> wouldn’t do anything
differently from the usual shallow copying and we can leave it out.</p>
<p>Rust has a special annotation called the <code>Copy</code> trait that we can place on
types like integers that are stored on the stack (we’ll talk more about traits
in Chapter 10). If a type has the <code>Copy</code> trait, an older variable is still
usable after assignment. Rust won’t let us annotate a type with the <code>Copy</code>
trait if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the <code>Drop</code> trait. If
the type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and
we add the <code>Copy</code> annotation to that type, we’ll get a compile time error. To
learn about how to add the <code>Copy</code> annotation to your type, see Appendix C on
Derivable Traits.</p>
<p>So what types are <code>Copy</code>? You can check the documentation for the given type to
be sure, but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar values can be
<code>Copy</code>, and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource is
<code>Copy</code>. Here are some of the types that are <code>Copy</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the integer types, like <code>u32</code>.</li>
<li>The Boolean type, <code>bool</code>, with values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>The character type, <code>char</code>.</li>
<li>All the floating point types, like <code>f64</code>.</li>
<li>Tuples, but only if they contain types that are also <code>Copy</code>. <code>(i32, i32)</code> is
<code>Copy</code>, but <code>(i32, String)</code> is not.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#ownership-and-functions" id="ownership-and-functions"><h3>Ownership and Functions</h3></a>
<p>The semantics for passing a value to a function are similar to assigning a
value to a variable. Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just
like assignment. Listing 4-3 has an example with some annotations showing where
variables go into and out of scope:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);  // s comes into scope.

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here.

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope.

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it’s okay to still
                                    // use x afterward.

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But since s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope.
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope.
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-3: Functions with ownership and scope
annotated</span></p>
<p>If we tried to use <code>s</code> after the call to <code>takes_ownership</code>, Rust would throw a
compile time error. These static checks protect us from mistakes. Try adding
code to <code>main</code> that uses <code>s</code> and <code>x</code> to see where you can use them and where
the ownership rules prevent you from doing so.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#return-values-and-scope" id="return-values-and-scope"><h3>Return Values and Scope</h3></a>
<p>Returning values can also transfer ownership. Here’s an example with similar
annotations to those in Listing 4-3:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1.

    let s2 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);     // s2 comes into scope.

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3.
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 goes out of scope but was
  // moved, so nothing happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -&gt; String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it.

    let some_string = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;); // some_string comes into scope.

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function.
}

// takes_and_gives_back will take a String and return one.
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -&gt; String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope.

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function.
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a
value to another variable moves it. When a variable that includes data on the
heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by <code>drop</code> unless the data
has been moved to be owned by another variable.</p>
<p>Taking ownership and then returning ownership with every function is a bit
tedious. What if we want to let a function use a value but not take ownership?
It’s quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to be passed back if we
want to use it again, in addition to any data resulting from the body of the
function that we might want to return as well.</p>
<p>It’s possible to return multiple values using a tuple, like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!(&quot;The length of '{}' is {}.&quot;, s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -&gt; (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String.

    (s, length)
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that should be
common. Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for this concept, and it’s called
<em>references</em>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#references-and-borrowing" id="references-and-borrowing"><h2>References and Borrowing</h2></a>
<p>The issue with the tuple code at the end of the preceding section is that we
have to return the <code>String</code> to the calling function so we can still use the
<code>String</code> after the call to <code>calculate_length</code>, because the <code>String</code> was moved
into <code>calculate_length</code>.</p>
<p>Here is how you would define and use a <code>calculate_length</code> function that has a
<em>reference</em> to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the
value:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    let len = calculate_length(&amp;s1);

    println!(&quot;The length of '{}' is {}.&quot;, s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {
    s.len()
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>First, notice that all the tuple code in the variable declaration and the
function return value is gone. Second, note that we pass <code>&amp;s1</code> into
<code>calculate_length</code>, and in its definition, we take <code>&amp;String</code> rather than
<code>String</code>.</p>
<p>These ampersands are <em>references</em>, and they allow you to refer to some value
without taking ownership of it. Figure 4-5 shows a diagram.</p>
<p><img alt="&String s pointing at String s1" src="img/trpl04-05.svg" class="center" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-5: <code>&amp;String s</code> pointing at <code>String s1</code></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The opposite of referencing by using <code>&amp;</code> is <em>dereferencing</em>, which is
accomplished with the dereference operator, <code>*</code>. We’ll see some uses of the
dereference operator in Chapter 8 and discuss details of dereferencing in
Chapter 15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the function call here:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# fn calculate_length(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {
#     s.len()
# }
let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

let len = calculate_length(&amp;s1);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>&amp;s1</code> syntax lets us create a reference that <em>refers</em> to the value of <code>s1</code>
but does not own it. Because it does not own it, the value it points to will
not be dropped when the reference goes out of scope.</p>
<p>Likewise, the signature of the function uses <code>&amp;</code> to indicate that the type of
the parameter <code>s</code> is a reference. Let’s add some explanatory annotations:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn calculate_length(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize { // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, nothing happens.
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The scope in which the variable <code>s</code> is valid is the same as any function
parameter’s scope, but we don’t drop what the reference points to when it goes
out of scope because we don’t have ownership. Functions that have references as
parameters instead of the actual values mean we won’t need to return the values
in order to give back ownership, since we never had ownership.</p>
<p>We call having references as function parameters <em>borrowing</em>. As in real life,
if a person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you’re done, you
have to give it back.</p>
<p>So what happens if we try to modify something we’re borrowing? Try the code in
Listing 4-4. Spoiler alert: it doesn’t work!</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

}

<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-4: Attempting to modify a borrowed value</span></p>

<p>Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. We’re not
allowed to modify something we have a reference to.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#mutable-references" id="mutable-references"><h3>Mutable References</h3></a>
<p>We can fix the error in the code from Listing 4-4 with just a small tweak:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    change(&amp;mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &amp;mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(&quot;, world&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>First, we had to change <code>s</code> to be <code>mut</code>. Then we had to create a mutable
reference with <code>&amp;mut s</code> and accept a mutable reference with <code>some_string: &amp;mut String</code>.</p>
<p>But mutable references have one big restriction: you can only have one mutable
reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope. This code will
fail:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

let r1 = &amp;mut s;
let r2 = &amp;mut s;
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s the error:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This restriction allows for mutation but in a very controlled fashion. It’s
something that new Rustaceans struggle with, because most languages let you
mutate whenever you’d like. The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust
can prevent data races at compile time.</p>
<p>A <em>data race</em> is similar to a race condition and happens when these three
behaviors occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.</li>
<li>At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.</li>
<li>There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Data races cause undefined behavior and can be difficult to diagnose and fix
when you’re trying to track them down at runtime; Rust prevents this problem
from happening because it won’t even compile code with data races!</p>
<p>As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for
multiple mutable references, just not <em>simultaneous</em> ones:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

{
    let r1 = &amp;mut s;

} // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

let r2 = &amp;mut s;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>A similar rule exists for combining mutable and immutable references. This code
results in an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

let r1 = &amp;s; // no problem
let r2 = &amp;s; // no problem
let r3 = &amp;mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

<p>Whew! We <em>also</em> cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one.
Users of an immutable reference don’t expect the values to suddenly change out
from under them! However, multiple immutable references are okay because no one
who is just reading the data has the ability to affect anyone else’s reading of
the data.</p>
<p>Even though these errors may be frustrating at times, remember that it’s the
Rust compiler pointing out a potential bug early (at compile time rather than
at runtime) and showing you exactly where the problem is instead of you having
to track down why sometimes your data isn’t what you thought it should be.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dangling-references" id="dangling-references"><h3>Dangling References</h3></a>
<p>In languages with pointers, it’s easy to erroneously create a <em>dangling
pointer</em>, a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been
given to someone else, by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to
that memory. In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references will
never be dangling references: if we have a reference to some data, the compiler
will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the
data does.</p>
<p>Let’s try to create a dangling reference, which Rust will prevent with a
compile-time error:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -&gt; &amp;String {
    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    &amp;s
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s the error:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This error message refers to a feature we haven’t covered yet: <em>lifetimes</em>.
We’ll discuss lifetimes in detail in Chapter 10. But, if you disregard the
parts about lifetimes, the message does contain the key to why this code is a
problem:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value
for it to be borrowed from.
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at exactly what’s happening at each stage of our
<code>dangle</code> code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn dangle() -&gt; &amp;String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;); // s is a new String

    &amp;s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!
</code></pre>
<p>Because <code>s</code> is created inside <code>dangle</code>, when the code of <code>dangle</code> is finished,
<code>s</code> will be deallocated. But we tried to return a reference to it. That means
this reference would be pointing to an invalid <code>String</code>! That’s no good. Rust
won’t let us do this.</p>
<p>The solution here is to return the <code>String</code> directly:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn no_dangle() -&gt; String {
    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    s
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This works without any problems. Ownership is moved out, and nothing is
deallocated.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-rules-of-references" id="the-rules-of-references"><h3>The Rules of References</h3></a>
<p>Let’s recap what we’ve discussed about references:</p>
<ol>
<li>At any given time, you can have <em>either</em> but not both of:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>One mutable reference.</li>
<li>Any number of immutable references.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>References must always be valid.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, we’ll look at a different kind of reference: slices.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#slices" id="slices"><h2>Slices</h2></a>
<p>Another data type that does not have ownership is the <em>slice</em>. Slices let you
reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the
whole collection.</p>
<p>Here’s a small programming problem: write a function that takes a string and
returns the first word it finds in that string. If the function doesn’t find a
space in the string, it means the whole string is one word, so the entire
string should be returned.</p>
<p>Let’s think about the signature of this function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; ?
</code></pre>
<p>This function, <code>first_word</code>, has a <code>&amp;String</code> as a parameter. We don’t want
ownership, so this is fine. But what should we return? We don’t really have a
way to talk about <em>part</em> of a string. However, we could return the index of the
end of the word. Let’s try that as shown in Listing 4-5:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &amp;item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return i;
        }
    }

    s.len()
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-5: The <code>first_word</code> function that returns a
byte index value into the <code>String</code> parameter</span></p>
<p>Let’s break down this code a bit. Because we need to go through the <code>String</code>
element by element and check whether a value is a space, we’ll convert our
<code>String</code> to an array of bytes using the <code>as_bytes</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let bytes = s.as_bytes();
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we create an iterator over the array of bytes using the <code>iter</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">for (i, &amp;item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
</code></pre>
<p>We’ll discuss iterators in more detail in Chapter 13. For now, know that <code>iter</code>
is a method that returns each element in a collection, and <code>enumerate</code> wraps
the result of <code>iter</code> and returns each element as part of a tuple instead. The
first element of the returned tuple is the index, and the second element is a
reference to the element. This is a bit more convenient than calculating the
index ourselves.</p>
<p>Because the <code>enumerate</code> method returns a tuple, we can use patterns to
destructure that tuple, just like everywhere else in Rust. So in the <code>for</code>
loop, we specify a pattern that has <code>i</code> for the index in the tuple and <code>&amp;item</code>
for the single byte in the tuple. Because we get a reference to the element
from <code>.iter().enumerate()</code>, we use <code>&amp;</code> in the pattern.</p>
<p>We search for the byte that represents the space by using the byte literal
syntax. If we find a space, we return the position. Otherwise, we return the
length of the string by using <code>s.len()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    if item == b' ' {
        return i;
    }
}
s.len()
</code></pre>
<p>We now have a way to find out the index of the end of the first word in the
string, but there’s a problem. We’re returning a <code>usize</code> on its own, but it’s
only a meaningful number in the context of the <code>&amp;String</code>. In other words,
because it’s a separate value from the <code>String</code>, there’s no guarantee that it
will still be valid in the future. Consider the program in Listing 4-6 that
uses the <code>first_word</code> function from Listing 4-5:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {
#     let bytes = s.as_bytes();
#
#     for (i, &amp;item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
#         if item == b' ' {
#             return i;
#         }
#     }
#
#     s.len()
# }
#
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello world&quot;);

    let word = first_word(&amp;s); // word will get the value 5.

    s.clear(); // This empties the String, making it equal to &quot;&quot;.

    // word still has the value 5 here, but there's no more string that
    // we could meaningfully use the value 5 with. word is now totally invalid!
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-6: Storing the result from calling the
<code>first_word</code> function then changing the <code>String</code> contents</span></p>
<p>This program compiles without any errors and also would if we used <code>word</code> after
calling <code>s.clear()</code>. <code>word</code> isn’t connected to the state of <code>s</code> at all, so
<code>word</code> still contains the value <code>5</code>. We could use that value <code>5</code> with the
variable <code>s</code> to try to extract the first word out, but this would be a bug
because the contents of <code>s</code> have changed since we saved <code>5</code> in <code>word</code>.</p>
<p>Having to worry about the index in <code>word</code> getting out of sync with the data in
<code>s</code> is tedious and error prone! Managing these indices is even more brittle if
we write a <code>second_word</code> function. Its signature would have to look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn second_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; (usize, usize) {
</code></pre>
<p>Now we’re tracking a start <em>and</em> an ending index, and we have even more values
that were calculated from data in a particular state but aren’t tied to that
state at all. We now have three unrelated variables floating around that need
to be kept in sync.</p>
<p>Luckily, Rust has a solution to this problem: string slices.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#string-slices" id="string-slices"><h3>String Slices</h3></a>
<p>A <em>string slice</em> is a reference to part of a <code>String</code>, and looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let s = String::from(&quot;hello world&quot;);

let hello = &amp;s[0..5];
let world = &amp;s[6..11];
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This is similar to taking a reference to the whole <code>String</code> but with the extra
<code>[0..5]</code> bit. Rather than a reference to the entire <code>String</code>, it’s a reference
to a portion of the <code>String</code>. The <code>start..end</code> syntax is a range that begins at
<code>start</code> and continues up to, but not including, <code>end</code>.</p>
<p>We can create slices using a range within brackets by specifying
<code>[starting_index..ending_index]</code>, where <code>starting_index</code> is the first position
included in the slice and <code>ending_index</code> is one more than the last position
included in the slice. Internally, the slice data structure stores the starting
position and the length of the slice, which corresponds to <code>ending_index</code> minus
<code>starting_index</code>. So in the case of <code>let world = &amp;s[6..11];</code>, <code>world</code> would be
a slice that contains a pointer to the 6th byte of <code>s</code> and a length value of 5.</p>
<p>Figure 4-6 shows this in a diagram.</p>
<p><img alt="world containing a pointer to the 6th byte of String s and a length 5" src="img/trpl04-06.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-6: String slice referring to part of a
<code>String</code></span></p>
<p>With Rust’s <code>..</code> range syntax, if you want to start at the first index (zero),
you can drop the value before the two periods. In other words, these are equal:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

let slice = &amp;s[0..2];
let slice = &amp;s[..2];
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>By the same token, if your slice includes the last byte of the <code>String</code>, you
can drop the trailing number. That means these are equal:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

let len = s.len();

let slice = &amp;s[3..len];
let slice = &amp;s[3..];
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>You can also drop both values to take a slice of the entire string. So these
are equal:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

let len = s.len();

let slice = &amp;s[0..len];
let slice = &amp;s[..];
#}</code></pre></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: String slice range indices must occur at valid UTF-8 character
boundaries. If you attempt to create a string slice in the middle of a
multibyte character, your program will exit with an error. For the purposes
of introducing string slices, we are assuming ASCII only in this section; a
more thorough discussion of UTF-8 handling is in the “Strings” section of
Chapter 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With all this information in mind, let’s rewrite <code>first_word</code> to return a
slice. The type that signifies “string slice” is written as <code>&amp;str</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &amp;item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &amp;s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &amp;s[..]
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We get the index for the end of the word in the same way as we did in Listing
4-5, by looking for the first occurrence of a space. When we find a space, we
return a string slice using the start of the string and the index of the space
as the starting and ending indices.</p>
<p>Now when we call <code>first_word</code>, we get back a single value that is tied to the
underlying data. The value is made up of a reference to the starting point of
the slice and the number of elements in the slice.</p>
<p>Returning a slice would also work for a <code>second_word</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn second_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>We now have a straightforward API that’s much harder to mess up, since the
compiler will ensure the references into the <code>String</code> remain valid. Remember
the bug in the program in Listing 4-6, when we got the index to the end of the
first word but then cleared the string so our index was invalid? That code was
logically incorrect but didn’t show any immediate errors. The problems would
show up later if we kept trying to use the first word index with an emptied
string. Slices make this bug impossible and let us know we have a problem with
our code much sooner. Using the slice version of <code>first_word</code> will throw a
compile time error:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello world&quot;);

    let word = first_word(&amp;s);

    s.clear(); // Error!
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s the compiler error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --&gt; src/main.rs:6:5
  |
4 |     let word = first_word(&amp;s);

5 |
6 |     s.clear(); // Error!
  |     ^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 | }
  | - immutable borrow ends here
</code></pre>
<p>Recall from the borrowing rules that if we have an immutable reference to
something, we cannot also take a mutable reference. Because <code>clear</code> needs to
truncate the <code>String</code>, it tries to take a mutable reference, which fails. Not
only has Rust made our API easier to use, but it has also eliminated an entire
class of errors at compile time!</p>

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The type of <code>s</code> here is <code>&amp;str</code>: it’s a slice pointing to that specific point of
the binary. This is also why string literals are immutable; <code>&amp;str</code> is an
immutable reference.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#string-slices-as-parameters" id="string-slices-as-parameters"><h4>String Slices as Parameters</h4></a>
<p>Knowing that you can take slices of literals and <code>String</code>s leads us to one more
improvement on <code>first_word</code>, and that’s its signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>A more experienced Rustacean would write the following line instead because it
allows us to use the same function on both <code>String</code>s and <code>&amp;str</code>s:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word(s: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>If we have a string slice, we can pass that directly. If we have a <code>String</code>, we
can pass a slice of the entire <code>String</code>. Defining a function to take a string
slice instead of a reference to a String makes our API more general and useful
without losing any functionality:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># fn first_word(s: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {

#         if item == b' ' {

    let my_string = String::from(&quot;hello world&quot;);

    // first_word works on slices of `String`s
    let word = first_word(&amp;my_string[..]);

    let my_string_literal = &quot;hello world&quot;;

    // first_word works on slices of string literals
    let word = first_word(&amp;my_string_literal[..]);

    // since string literals *are* string slices already,
    // this works too, without the slice syntax!
    let word = first_word(my_string_literal);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#other-slices" id="other-slices"><h3>Other Slices</h3></a>
<p>String slices, as you might imagine, are specific to strings. But there’s a
more general slice type, too. Consider this array:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Just like we might want to refer to a part of a string, we might want to refer
to part of an array and would do so like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let slice = &amp;a[1..3];
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This slice has the type <code>&amp;[i32]</code>. It works the same way as string slices do, by
storing a reference to the first element and a length. You’ll use this kind of
slice for all sorts of other collections. We’ll discuss these collections in
detail when we talk about vectors in Chapter 8.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#summary-2" id="summary-2"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>The concepts of ownership, borrowing, and slices are what ensure memory safety
in Rust programs at compile time. The Rust language gives you control over your
memory usage like other systems programming languages, but having the owner of
data automatically clean up that data when the owner goes out of scope means
you don’t have to write and debug extra code to get this control.</p>
<p>Ownership affects how lots of other parts of Rust work, so we’ll talk about
these concepts further throughout the rest of the book. Let’s move on to the
next chapter and look at grouping pieces of data together in a <code>struct</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-structs-to-structure-related-data" id="using-structs-to-structure-related-data"><h1>Using Structs to Structure Related Data</h1></a>
<p>A <em>struct</em>, or <em>structure</em>, is a custom data type that lets us name and package
together multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. If you’re
familiar with an object-oriented language, a <em>struct</em> is like an object’s data
attributes. In this chapter, we’ll compare and contrast tuples with structs,
demonstrate how to use structs, and discuss how to define methods and
associated functions to specify behavior associated with a struct’s data. The
struct and <em>enum</em> (which is discussed in Chapter 6) concepts are the building
blocks for creating new types in your program’s domain to take full advantage
of Rust’s compile time type checking.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#defining-and-instantiating-structs" id="defining-and-instantiating-structs"><h2>Defining and Instantiating Structs</h2></a>
<p>Structs are similar to tuples, which were discussed in Chapter 3. Like tuples,
the pieces of a struct can be different types. Unlike tuples, we name each
piece of data so it’s clear what the values mean. As a result of these names,
structs are more flexible than tuples: we don’t have to rely on the order of
the data to specify or access the values of an instance.</p>
<p>To define a struct, we enter the keyword <code>struct</code> and name the entire struct. A
struct’s name should describe the significance of the pieces of data being
grouped together. Then, inside curly brackets, we define the names and types of
the pieces of data, which we call <em>fields</em>. For example, Listing 5-1 shows a
struct to store information about a user account:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-1: A <code>User</code> struct definition</span></p>
<p>To use a struct after we’ve defined it, we create an <em>instance</em> of that struct
by specifying concrete values for each of the fields. We create an instance by
stating the name of the struct, and then add curly brackets containing <code>key: value</code> pairs where the keys are the names of the fields and the values are the
data we want to store in those fields. We don’t have to specify the fields in
the same order in which we declared them in the struct. In other words, the
struct definition is like a general template for the type, and instances fill
in that template with particular data to create values of the type. For
example, we can declare a particular user as shown in Listing 5-2:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# struct User {
#     username: String,
#     email: String,
#     sign_in_count: u64,
#     active: bool,
# }
#
let user1 = User {
    email: String::from(&quot;someone@example.com&quot;),
    username: String::from(&quot;someusername123&quot;),
    active: true,
    sign_in_count: 1,
};
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-2: Creating an instance of the <code>User</code>
struct</span></p>
<p>To get a specific value from a struct, we can use dot notation. If we wanted
just this user’s email address, we can use <code>user1.email</code> wherever we want to
use this value. If the instance is mutable, we can change a value by using the
dot notation and assigning into a particular field. Listing 5-3 shows how to
change the value in the <code>email</code> field of a mutable <code>User</code> instance:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# struct User {
#     username: String,
#     email: String,
#     sign_in_count: u64,
#     active: bool,
# }
#
let mut user1 = User {
    email: String::from(&quot;someone@example.com&quot;),
    username: String::from(&quot;someusername123&quot;),
    active: true,
    sign_in_count: 1,
};

user1.email = String::from(&quot;anotheremail@example.com&quot;);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-3: Changing the value in the <code>email</code> field of a
<code>User</code> instance</span></p>
<p>Note that the entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn’t allow us to mark
only certain fields as mutable. Also note that as with any expression, we can
construct a new instance of the struct as the last expression in the function
body to implicitly return that new instance.</p>
<p>Listing 5-4 shows a <code>build_user</code> function that returns a <code>User</code> instance with
the given email and username. The <code>active</code> field gets the value of <code>true</code>, and
the <code>sign_in_count</code> gets a value of <code>1</code>.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-4: A <code>build_user</code> function that takes an email
and username and returns a <code>User</code> instance</span></p>
<p>It makes sense to name the function arguments with the same name as the struct
fields, but having to repeat the <code>email</code> and <code>username</code> field names and
variables is a bit tedious. If the struct had more fields, repeating each name
would get even more annoying. Luckily, there’s a convenient shorthand!</p>

<p>Because the parameter names and the struct field names are exactly the same in
Listing 5-4, we can use the <em>field init shorthand</em> syntax to rewrite

<p>It’s often useful to create a new instance of a struct that uses most of an old
instance’s values, but changes some. We do this using <em>struct update syntax</em>.</p>
<p>First, Listing 5-6 shows how we create a new <code>User</code> instance in <code>user2</code> without
the update syntax. We set new values for <code>email</code> and <code>username</code>, but otherwise
use the same values from <code>user1</code> that we created in Listing 5-2:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-6: Creating a new <code>User</code> instance using some of

<p>Using struct update syntax, we can achieve the same effect with less code, as
shown in Listing 5-7. The syntax <code>..</code> specifies that the remaining fields not
explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#tuple-structs-without-named-fields-to-create-different-types" id="tuple-structs-without-named-fields-to-create-different-types"><h3>Tuple Structs without Named Fields to Create Different Types</h3></a>
<p>We can also define structs that look similar to tuples (which were discussed in
Chapter 3), called <em>tuple structs</em>, that have the added meaning the struct name
provides, but don’t have names associated with their fields; rather, they just
have the types of the fields. Tuple structs are useful when you want to give
the whole tuple a name and make the tuple be a different type than other
tuples, but naming each field as in a regular struct would be verbose or
redundant.</p>
<p>To define a tuple struct you start with the <code>struct</code> keyword and the struct
name followed by the types in the tuple. For example, here are definitions and
usages of two tuple structs named <code>Color</code> and <code>Point</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>black</code> and <code>origin</code> values are different types, since they’re
instances of different tuple structs. Each struct we define is its own type,
even though the fields within the struct have the same types. For example, a
function that takes a parameter of type <code>Color</code> cannot take a <code>Point</code> as an
argument, even though both types are made up of three <code>i32</code> values. Otherwise,
tuple struct instances behave like tuples: you can destructure them into their
individual pieces and you can use a <code>.</code> followed by the index to access an
individual value, and so on.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#unit-like-structs-without-any-fields" id="unit-like-structs-without-any-fields"><h3>Unit-Like Structs without Any Fields</h3></a>
<p>We can also define structs that don’t have any fields! These are called
<em>unit-like structs</em> since they behave similarly to <code>()</code>, the unit type.
Unit-like structs can be useful in situations such as when you need to
implement a trait on some type, but you don’t have any data that you want to
store in the type itself. We’ll discuss traits in Chapter 10.</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#ownership-of-struct-data" id="ownership-of-struct-data"><h3>Ownership of Struct Data</h3></a>
<p>In the <code>User</code> struct definition in Listing 5-1, we used the owned <code>String</code>
type rather than the <code>&amp;str</code> string slice type. This is a deliberate choice
because we want instances of this struct to own all of its data and for that
data to be valid for as long as the entire struct is valid.</p>
<p>It’s possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else,
but to do so requires the use of <em>lifetimes</em>, a Rust feature that we’ll
discuss in Chapter 10. Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct
is valid for as long as the struct is. Let’s say you try to store a reference
in a struct without specifying lifetimes, like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct User {
    username: &amp;str,
    email: &amp;str,

    active: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        email: &quot;someone@example.com&quot;,
        username: &quot;someusername123&quot;,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>The compiler will complain that it needs lifetime specifiers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --&gt;
  |
2 |     username: &amp;str,
  |               ^ expected lifetime parameter

 --&gt;
  |
3 |     email: &amp;str,
  |            ^ expected lifetime parameter
</code></pre>
<p>In Chapter 10, we’ll discuss how to fix these errors so you can store
references in structs, but for now, we’ll fix errors like these using owned
types like <code>String</code> instead of references like <code>&amp;str</code>.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#an-example-program-using-structs" id="an-example-program-using-structs"><h2>An Example Program Using Structs</h2></a>
<p>To understand when we might want to use structs, let’s write a program that
calculates the area of a rectangle. We’ll start with single variables, and then
refactor the program until we’re using structs instead.</p>
<p>Let’s make a new binary project with Cargo called <em>rectangles</em> that will take
the width and height of a rectangle specified in pixels and will calculate the
area of the rectangle. Listing 5-8 shows a short program with one way of doing
just that in our project’s <em>src/main.rs</em>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let width1 = 30;
    let height1 = 50;

    println!(
        &quot;The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.&quot;,
        area(width1, height1)
    );
}

fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -&gt; u32 {
    width * height
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-8: Calculating the area of a rectangle
specified by its width and height in separate variables</span></p>
<p>Now, run this program using <code>cargo run</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">The area of the rectangle is 1500 square pixels.
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#refactoring-with-tuples" id="refactoring-with-tuples"><h3>Refactoring with Tuples</h3></a>
<p>Even though Listing 5-8 works and figures out the area of the rectangle by
calling the <code>area</code> function with each dimension, we can do better. The width
and the height are related to each other because together they describe one
rectangle.</p>
<p>The issue with this code is evident in the signature of <code>area</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -&gt; u32 {
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>area</code> function is supposed to calculate the area of one rectangle, but the
function we wrote has two parameters. The parameters are related, but that’s
not expressed anywhere in our program. It would be more readable and more
manageable to group width and height together. We’ve already discussed one way
we might do that in the “Grouping Values into Tuples” section of Chapter 3: by
using tuples. Listing 5-9 shows another version of our program that uses tuples:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let rect1 = (30, 50);

    println!(
        &quot;The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.&quot;,
        area(rect1)
    );
}

fn area(dimensions: (u32, u32)) -&gt; u32 {
    dimensions.0 * dimensions.1
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-9: Specifying the width and height of the
rectangle with a tuple</span></p>
<p>In one way, this program is better. Tuples let us add a bit of structure, and
we’re now passing just one argument. But in another way this version is less
clear: tuples don’t name their elements, so our calculation has become more
confusing because we have to index into the parts of the tuple.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if we mix up width and height for the area calculation, but
if we want to draw the rectangle on the screen, it would matter! We would have
to keep in mind that <code>width</code> is the tuple index <code>0</code> and <code>height</code> is the tuple
index <code>1</code>. If someone else worked on this code, they would have to figure this
out and keep it in mind as well. It would be easy to forget or mix up these
values and cause errors, because we haven’t conveyed the meaning of our data in
our code.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#refactoring-with-structs-adding-more-meaning" id="refactoring-with-structs-adding-more-meaning"><h3>Refactoring with Structs: Adding More Meaning</h3></a>
<p>We use structs to add meaning by labeling the data. We can transform the tuple
we’re using into a data type with a name for the whole as well as names for the
parts, as shown in Listing 5-10:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,

    let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 };

    println!(
        &quot;The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.&quot;,
        area(&amp;rect1)
    );
}

fn area(rectangle: &amp;Rectangle) -&gt; u32 {
    rectangle.width * rectangle.height
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-10: Defining a <code>Rectangle</code> struct</span></p>
<p>Here we’ve defined a struct and named it <code>Rectangle</code>. Inside the <code>{}</code> we
defined the fields as <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, both of which have type <code>u32</code>. Then
in <code>main</code> we create a particular instance of a <code>Rectangle</code> that has a width of
30 and a height of 50.</p>
<p>Our <code>area</code> function is now defined with one parameter, which we’ve named
<code>rectangle</code>, whose type is an immutable borrow of a struct <code>Rectangle</code>
instance. As mentioned in Chapter 4, we want to borrow the struct rather than
take ownership of it. This way, <code>main</code> retains its ownership and can continue
using <code>rect1</code>, which is the reason we use the <code>&amp;</code> in the function signature and
where we call the function.</p>
<p>The <code>area</code> function accesses the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> fields of the <code>Rectangle</code>
instance. Our function signature for <code>area</code> now says exactly what we mean:
calculate the area of a <code>Rectangle</code>, using its <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> fields.
This conveys that the width and height are related to each other, and gives
descriptive names to the values rather than using the tuple index values of <code>0</code>
and <code>1</code>. This is a win for clarity.</p>

any other primitive type to a user. But with structs, the way <code>println!</code> should
format the output is less clear because there are more display possibilities:
do you want commas or not? Do you want to print the curly brackets? Should all
the fields be shown? Due to this ambiguity, Rust doesn’t try to guess what we
want and structs don’t have a provided implementation of <code>Display</code>.</p>
<p>If we continue reading the errors, we’ll find this helpful note:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">`Rectangle` cannot be formatted with the default formatter; try using
`:?` instead if you are using a format string
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s try it! The <code>println!</code> macro call will now look like <code>println!(&quot;rect1 is {:?}&quot;, rect1);</code>. Putting the specifier <code>:?</code> inside the <code>{}</code> tells <code>println!</code> we
want to use an output format called <code>Debug</code>. <code>Debug</code> is a trait that enables us
to print out our struct in a way that is useful for developers so we can see
its value while we’re debugging our code.</p>
<p>Run the code with this change. Drat! We still get an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0277]: the trait bound `Rectangle: std::fmt::Debug` is not satisfied
</code></pre>
<p>But again, the compiler gives us a helpful note:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">`Rectangle` cannot be formatted using `:?`; if it is defined in your
crate, add `#[derive(Debug)]` or manually implement it
</code></pre>
<p>Rust <em>does</em> include functionality to print out debugging information, but we
have to explicitly opt-in to make that functionality available for our struct.
To do that, we add the annotation <code>#[derive(Debug)]</code> just before the struct
definition, as shown in Listing 5-12:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 };

    println!(&quot;rect1 is {:?}&quot;, rect1);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-12: Adding the annotation to derive the <code>Debug</code>
trait and printing the <code>Rectangle</code> instance using debug formatting</span></p>
<p>Now when we run the program, we won’t get any errors and we’ll see the
following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">rect1 is Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 }
</code></pre>
<p>Nice! It’s not the prettiest output, but it shows the values of all the fields
for this instance, which would definitely help during debugging. When we have
larger structs, it’s useful to have output that’s a bit easier to read; in
those cases, we can use <code>{:#?}</code> instead of <code>{:?}</code> in the <code>println!</code> string.
When we use the <code>{:#?}</code> style in the example, the output will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">rect1 is Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50
}
</code></pre>
<p>Rust has provided a number of traits for us to use with the <code>derive</code> annotation
that can add useful behavior to our custom types. Those traits and their
behaviors are listed in Appendix C. We’ll cover how to implement these traits
with custom behavior as well as how to create your own traits in Chapter 10.</p>
<p>Our <code>area</code> function is very specific: it only computes the area of rectangles.
It would be helpful to tie this behavior more closely to our <code>Rectangle</code>
struct, because it won’t work with any other type. Let’s look at how we can
continue to refactor this code by turning the <code>area</code> function into an <code>area</code>
<em>method</em> defined on our <code>Rectangle</code> type.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#method-syntax" id="method-syntax"><h2>Method Syntax</h2></a>
<p><em>Methods</em> are similar to functions: they’re declared with the <code>fn</code> keyword and
their name, they can have parameters and a return value, and they contain some
code that is run when they’re called from somewhere else. However, methods are
different from functions in that they’re defined within the context of a struct
(or an enum or a trait object, which we cover in Chapters 6 and 17,
respectively), and their first parameter is always <code>self</code>, which represents the
instance of the struct the method is being called on.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#defining-methods" id="defining-methods"><h3>Defining Methods</h3></a>
<p>Let’s change the <code>area</code> function that has a <code>Rectangle</code> instance as a parameter
and instead make an <code>area</code> method defined on the <code>Rectangle</code> struct, as shown
in Listing 5-13:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 };

    println!(
        &quot;The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.&quot;,
        rect1.area()
    );
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-13: Defining an <code>area</code> method on the
<code>Rectangle</code> struct</span></p>
<p>To define the function within the context of <code>Rectangle</code>, we start an <code>impl</code>
(<em>implementation</em>) block. Then we move the <code>area</code> function within the <code>impl</code>
curly brackets and change the first (and in this case, only) parameter to be
<code>self</code> in the signature and everywhere within the body. In <code>main</code> where we
called the <code>area</code> function and passed <code>rect1</code> as an argument, we can instead
use <em>method syntax</em> to call the <code>area</code> method on our <code>Rectangle</code> instance.
The method syntax goes after an instance: we add a dot followed by the method
name, parentheses, and any arguments.</p>
<p>In the signature for <code>area</code>, we use <code>&amp;self</code> instead of <code>rectangle: &amp;Rectangle</code>
because Rust knows the type of <code>self</code> is <code>Rectangle</code> due to this method being
inside the <code>impl Rectangle</code> context. Note that we still need to use the <code>&amp;</code>
before <code>self</code>, just like we did in <code>&amp;Rectangle</code>. Methods can take ownership of
<code>self</code>, borrow <code>self</code> immutably as we’ve done here, or borrow <code>self</code> mutably,
just like any other parameter.</p>
<p>We’ve chosen <code>&amp;self</code> here for the same reason we used <code>&amp;Rectangle</code> in the
function version: we don’t want to take ownership, and we just want to read the
data in the struct, not write to it. If we wanted to change the instance that
we’ve called the method on as part of what the method does, we’d use <code>&amp;mut self</code> as the first parameter. Having a method that takes ownership of the
instance by using just <code>self</code> as the first parameter is rare; this technique is
usually used when the method transforms <code>self</code> into something else and we want
to prevent the caller from using the original instance after the transformation.</p>
<p>The main benefit of using methods instead of functions, in addition to using
method syntax and not having to repeat the type of <code>self</code> in every method’s
signature, is for organization. We’ve put all the things we can do with an
instance of a type in one <code>impl</code> block rather than making future users of our
code search for capabilities of <code>Rectangle</code> in various places in the library we
provide.</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#wheres-the---operator" id="wheres-the---operator"><h3>Where’s the <code>-&gt;</code> Operator?</h3></a>
<p>In languages like C++, two different operators are used for calling methods:
you use <code>.</code> if you’re calling a method on the object directly and <code>-&gt;</code> if
you’re calling the method on a pointer to the object and need to dereference
the pointer first. In other words, if <code>object</code> is a pointer,
<code>object-&gt;something()</code> is similar to <code>(*object).something()</code>.</p>
<p>Rust doesn’t have an equivalent to the <code>-&gt;</code> operator; instead, Rust has a
feature called <em>automatic referencing and dereferencing</em>. Calling methods is
one of the few places in Rust that has this behavior.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: when you call a method with <code>object.something()</code>, Rust
automatically adds in <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&amp;mut</code>, or <code>*</code> so <code>object</code> matches the signature of
the method. In other words, the following are the same:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# #[derive(Debug,Copy,Clone)]
# struct Point {
#     x: f64,
#     y: f64,
# }
#
# impl Point {
#    fn distance(&amp;self, other: &amp;Point) -&gt; f64 {
#        let x_squared = f64::powi(other.x - self.x, 2);
#        let y_squared = f64::powi(other.y - self.y, 2);
#
#        f64::sqrt(x_squared + y_squared)
#    }
# }
# let p1 = Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 };
# let p2 = Point { x: 5.0, y: 6.5 };
p1.distance(&amp;p2);
(&amp;p1).distance(&amp;p2);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The first one looks much cleaner. This automatic referencing behavior works
because methods have a clear receiver—the type of <code>self</code>. Given the receiver
and name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the method is
reading (<code>&amp;self</code>), mutating (<code>&amp;mut self</code>), or consuming (<code>self</code>). The fact
that Rust makes borrowing implicit for method receivers is a big part of
making ownership ergonomic in practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#methods-with-more-parameters" id="methods-with-more-parameters"><h3>Methods with More Parameters</h3></a>
<p>Let’s practice using methods by implementing a second method on the <code>Rectangle</code>
struct. This time, we want an instance of <code>Rectangle</code> to take another instance
of <code>Rectangle</code> and return <code>true</code> if the second <code>Rectangle</code> can fit completely
within <code>self</code>; otherwise it should return <code>false</code>. That is, we want to be able
to write the program shown in Listing 5-14, once we’ve defined the <code>can_hold</code>
method:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 };
    let rect2 = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 40 };
    let rect3 = Rectangle { width: 60, height: 45 };

    println!(&quot;Can rect1 hold rect2? {}&quot;, rect1.can_hold(&amp;rect2));
    println!(&quot;Can rect1 hold rect3? {}&quot;, rect1.can_hold(&amp;rect3));
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-14: Demonstration of using the as-yet-unwritten
<code>can_hold</code> method</span></p>
<p>And the expected output would look like the following, because both dimensions
of <code>rect2</code> are smaller than the dimensions of <code>rect1</code>, but <code>rect3</code> is wider
than <code>rect1</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Can rect1 hold rect2? true
Can rect1 hold rect3? false
</code></pre>
<p>We know we want to define a method, so it will be within the <code>impl Rectangle</code>
block. The method name will be <code>can_hold</code>, and it will take an immutable borrow
of another <code>Rectangle</code> as a parameter. We can tell what the type of the
parameter will be by looking at the code that calls the method:
<code>rect1.can_hold(&amp;rect2)</code> passes in <code>&amp;rect2</code>, which is an immutable borrow to
<code>rect2</code>, an instance of <code>Rectangle</code>. This makes sense because we only need to
read <code>rect2</code> (rather than write, which would mean we’d need a mutable borrow),
and we want <code>main</code> to retain ownership of <code>rect2</code> so we can use it again after
calling the <code>can_hold</code> method. The return value of <code>can_hold</code> will be a
Boolean, and the implementation will check whether the width and height of
<code>self</code> are both greater than the width and height of the other <code>Rectangle</code>,
respectively. Let’s add the new <code>can_hold</code> method to the <code>impl</code> block from
Listing 5-13, shown in Listing 5-15:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# #[derive(Debug)]
# struct Rectangle {
#     width: u32,
#     height: u32,
# }
#
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn can_hold(&amp;self, other: &amp;Rectangle) -&gt; bool {
        self.width &gt; other.width &amp;&amp; self.height &gt; other.height
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-15: Implementing the <code>can_hold</code> method on
<code>Rectangle</code> that takes another <code>Rectangle</code> instance as a parameter</span></p>
<p>When we run this code with the <code>main</code> function in Listing 5-14, we’ll get our
desired output. Methods can take multiple parameters that we add to the
signature after the <code>self</code> parameter, and those parameters work just like
parameters in functions.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#associated-functions" id="associated-functions"><h3>Associated Functions</h3></a>
<p>Another useful feature of <code>impl</code> blocks is that we’re allowed to define
functions within <code>impl</code> blocks that <em>don’t</em> take <code>self</code> as a parameter. These
are called <em>associated functions</em> because they’re associated with the struct.
They’re still functions, not methods, because they don’t have an instance of
the struct to work with. You’ve already used the <code>String::from</code> associated
function.</p>
<p>Associated functions are often used for constructors that will return a new
instance of the struct. For example, we could provide an associated function
that would have one dimension parameter and use that as both width and height,
thus making it easier to create a square <code>Rectangle</code> rather than having to
specify the same value twice:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# #[derive(Debug)]
# struct Rectangle {
#     width: u32,
#     height: u32,
# }
#
impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -&gt; Rectangle {
        Rectangle { width: size, height: size }
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>To call this associated function, we use the <code>::</code> syntax with the struct name,
like <code>let sq = Rectangle::square(3);</code>, for example. This function is
namespaced by the struct: the <code>::</code> syntax is used for both associated functions
and namespaces created by modules, which we’ll discuss in Chapter 7.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#multiple-impl-blocks" id="multiple-impl-blocks"><h3>Multiple <code>impl</code> Blocks</h3></a>
<p>Each struct is allowed to have multiple <code>impl</code> blocks. For example, Listing
5-15 is equivalent to the code shown in Listing 5-16, which has each method
in its own <code>impl</code> block:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# #[derive(Debug)]
# struct Rectangle {
#     width: u32,
#     height: u32,
# }
#
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn can_hold(&amp;self, other: &amp;Rectangle) -&gt; bool {
        self.width &gt; other.width &amp;&amp; self.height &gt; other.height
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-16: Rewriting Listing 5-15 using multiple <code>impl</code>
blocks</span></p>
<p>There’s no reason to separate these methods into multiple <code>impl</code> blocks here,
but it’s valid syntax. We will see a case when multiple <code>impl</code> blocks are useful
in Chapter 10 when we discuss generic types and traits.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#summary-3" id="summary-3"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>Structs let us create custom types that are meaningful for our domain. By using
structs, we can keep associated pieces of data connected to each other and name
each piece to make our code clear. Methods let us specify the behavior that
instances of our structs have, and associated functions let us namespace
functionality that is particular to our struct without having an instance
available.</p>
<p>But structs aren’t the only way we can create custom types: let’s turn to
Rust’s enum feature to add another tool to our toolbox.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#enums-and-pattern-matching" id="enums-and-pattern-matching"><h1>Enums and Pattern Matching</h1></a>
<p>In this chapter we’ll look at <em>enumerations</em>, also referred to as <em>enums</em>.
Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible values. First,
we’ll define and use an enum to show how an enum can encode meaning along with
data. Next, we’ll explore a particularly useful enum, called <code>Option</code>, which
expresses that a value can be either something or nothing. Then we’ll look at
how pattern matching in the <code>match</code> expression makes it easy to run different
code for different values of an enum. Finally, we’ll cover how the <code>if let</code>
construct is another convenient and concise idiom available to you to handle
enums in your code.</p>
<p>Enums are a feature in many languages, but their capabilities differ in each
language. Rust’s enums are most similar to <em>algebraic data types</em> in functional
languages like F#, OCaml, and Haskell.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#defining-an-enum" id="defining-an-enum"><h2>Defining an Enum</h2></a>
<p>Let’s look at a situation we might want to express in code and see why enums
are useful and more appropriate than structs in this case. Say we need to work
with IP addresses. Currently, two major standards are used for IP addresses:
version four and version six. These are the only possibilities for an IP
address that our program will come across: we can <em>enumerate</em> all possible
values, which is where enumeration gets its name.</p>
<p>Any IP address can be either a version four or a version six address but not
both at the same time. That property of IP addresses makes the enum data
structure appropriate for this case, because enum values can only be one of the
variants. Both version four and version six addresses are still fundamentally
IP addresses, so they should be treated as the same type when the code is
handling situations that apply to any kind of IP address.</p>
<p>We can express this concept in code by defining an <code>IpAddrKind</code> enumeration and
listing the possible kinds an IP address can be, <code>V4</code> and <code>V6</code>. These are known
as the <em>variants</em> of the enum:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><code>IpAddrKind</code> is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in our code.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#enum-values" id="enum-values"><h3>Enum Values</h3></a>
<p>We can create instances of each of the two variants of <code>IpAddrKind</code> like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# enum IpAddrKind {
#     V4,
#     V6,
# }
#
let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that the variants of the enum are namespaced under its identifier, and we
use a double colon to separate the two. The reason this is useful is that now
both values <code>IpAddrKind::V4</code> and <code>IpAddrKind::V6</code> are of the same type:
<code>IpAddrKind</code>. We can then, for instance, define a function that takes any
<code>IpAddrKind</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# enum IpAddrKind {
#     V4,
#     V6,
# }
#
fn route(ip_type: IpAddrKind) { }
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>And we can call this function with either variant:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# enum IpAddrKind {
#     V4,
#     V6,
# }
#
# fn route(ip_type: IpAddrKind) { }
#
route(IpAddrKind::V4);
route(IpAddrKind::V6);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Using enums has even more advantages. Thinking more about our IP address type,
at the moment we don’t have a way to store the actual IP address <em>data</em>; we
only know what <em>kind</em> it is. Given that you just learned about structs in
Chapter 5, you might tackle this problem as shown in Listing 6-1:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}

struct IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind,
    address: String,
}

let home = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
    address: String::from(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;),
};

let loopback = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V6,
    address: String::from(&quot;::1&quot;),
};
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-1: Storing the data and <code>IpAddrKind</code> variant of
an IP address using a <code>struct</code></span></p>
<p>Here, we’ve defined a struct <code>IpAddr</code> that has two fields: a <code>kind</code> field that
is of type <code>IpAddrKind</code> (the enum we defined previously) and an <code>address</code> field
of type <code>String</code>. We have two instances of this struct. The first, <code>home</code>, has
the value <code>IpAddrKind::V4</code> as its <code>kind</code> with associated address data of
<code>127.0.0.1</code>. The second instance, <code>loopback</code>, has the other variant of
<code>IpAddrKind</code> as its <code>kind</code> value, <code>V6</code>, and has address <code>::1</code> associated with
it. We’ve used a struct to bundle the <code>kind</code> and <code>address</code> values together, so
now the variant is associated with the value.</p>
<p>We can represent the same concept in a more concise way using just an enum,
rather than an enum inside a struct, by putting data directly into each enum
variant. This new definition of the <code>IpAddr</code> enum says that both <code>V4</code> and <code>V6</code>
variants will have associated <code>String</code> values:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum IpAddr {
    V4(String),
    V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;));

let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from(&quot;::1&quot;));
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We attach data to each variant of the enum directly, so there is no need for an
extra struct.</p>
<p>There’s another advantage to using an enum rather than a struct: each variant
can have different types and amounts of associated data. Version four type IP
addresses will always have four numeric components that will have values
between 0 and 255. If we wanted to store <code>V4</code> addresses as four <code>u8</code> values but
still express <code>V6</code> addresses as one <code>String</code> value, we wouldn’t be able to with
a struct. Enums handle this case with ease:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum IpAddr {
    V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
    V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);

let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from(&quot;::1&quot;));
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We’ve shown several different possibilities that we could define in our code
for storing IP addresses of the two different varieties using an enum. However,
as it turns out, wanting to store IP addresses and encode which kind they are
is so common that <a href="../../std/net/enum.IpAddr.html">the standard library has a definition we can
use!</a><!-- ignore --> Let’s look at how the standard library defines
<code>IpAddr</code>: it has the exact enum and variants that we’ve defined and used, but
it embeds the address data inside the variants in the form of two different
structs, which are defined differently for each variant:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
struct Ipv4Addr {
    // details elided
}

struct Ipv6Addr {
    // details elided
}

enum IpAddr {
    V4(Ipv4Addr),
    V6(Ipv6Addr),
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code illustrates that you can put any kind of data inside an enum variant:
strings, numeric types, or structs, for example. You can even include another
enum! Also, standard library types are often not much more complicated than
what you might come up with.</p>
<p>Note that even though the standard library contains a definition for <code>IpAddr</code>,
we can still create and use our own definition without conflict because we
haven’t brought the standard library’s definition into our scope. We’ll talk
more about bringing types into scope in Chapter 7.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another example of an enum in Listing 6-2: this one has a wide
variety of types embedded in its variants:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-2: A <code>Message</code> enum whose variants each store
different amounts and types of values</span></p>
<p>This enum has four variants with different types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Quit</code> has no data associated with it at all.</li>
<li><code>Move</code> includes an anonymous struct inside it.</li>
<li><code>Write</code> includes a single <code>String</code>.</li>
<li><code>ChangeColor</code> includes three <code>i32</code> values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining an enum with variants like the ones in Listing 6-2 is similar to
defining different kinds of struct definitions except the enum doesn’t use the
<code>struct</code> keyword and all the variants are grouped together under the <code>Message</code>
type. The following structs could hold the same data that the preceding enum
variants hold:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
struct MoveMessage {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>But if we used the different structs, which each have their own type, we
wouldn’t be able to as easily define a function that could take any of these
kinds of messages as we could with the <code>Message</code> enum defined in Listing 6-2,
which is a single type.</p>
<p>There is one more similarity between enums and structs: just as we’re able to
define methods on structs using <code>impl</code>, we’re also able to define methods on
enums. Here’s a method named <code>call</code> that we could define on our <code>Message</code> enum:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# enum Message {
#     Quit,
#     Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
#     Write(String),
#     ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
# }
#
impl Message {
    fn call(&amp;self) {
        // method body would be defined here
    }
}

let m = Message::Write(String::from(&quot;hello&quot;));
m.call();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The body of the method would use <code>self</code> to get the value that we called the
method on. In this example, we’ve created a variable <code>m</code> that has the value
<code>Message::Write(String::from(&quot;hello&quot;))</code>, and that is what <code>self</code> will be in the body of the
<code>call</code> method when <code>m.call()</code> runs.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another enum in the standard library that is very common and
useful: <code>Option</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-option-enum-and-its-advantages-over-null-values" id="the-option-enum-and-its-advantages-over-null-values"><h3>The <code>Option</code> Enum and Its Advantages Over Null Values</h3></a>
<p>In the previous section, we looked at how the <code>IpAddr</code> enum let us use Rust’s
type system to encode more information than just the data into our program.
This section explores a case study of <code>Option</code>, which is another enum defined
by the standard library. The <code>Option</code> type is used in many places because it
encodes the very common scenario in which a value could be something or it
could be nothing. Expressing this concept in terms of the type system means the
compiler can check that you’ve handled all the cases you should be handling,
which can prevent bugs that are extremely common in other programming languages.</p>
<p>Programming language design is often thought of in terms of which features you
include, but the features you exclude are important too. Rust doesn’t have the
null feature that many other languages have. <em>Null</em> is a value that means there
is no value there. In languages with null, variables can always be in one of
two states: null or not-null.</p>
<p>In “Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake,” Tony Hoare, the inventor of
null, has this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I call it my billion-dollar mistake. At that time, I was designing the first
comprehensive type system for references in an object-oriented language. My
goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with
checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn’t resist the
temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to
implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system
crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in
the last forty years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem with null values is that if you try to actually use a value that’s
null as if it is a not-null value, you’ll get an error of some kind. Because
this null or not-null property is pervasive, it’s extremely easy to make this
kind of error.</p>
<p>However, the concept that null is trying to express is still a useful one: a
null is a value that is currently invalid or absent for some reason.</p>
<p>The problem isn’t with the actual concept but with the particular
implementation. As such, Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an enum
that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. This enum is
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, and it is <a href="../../std/option/enum.Option.html">defined by the standard library</a><!-- ignore -->
as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum Option&lt;T&gt; {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum is so useful that it’s even included in the prelude; you
don’t need to bring it into scope explicitly. In addition, so are its variants:
you can use <code>Some</code> and <code>None</code> directly without prefixing them with <code>Option::</code>.
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is still just a regular enum, and <code>Some(T)</code> and <code>None</code> are still
variants of type <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> syntax is a feature of Rust we haven’t talked about yet. It’s a
generic type parameter, and we’ll cover generics in more detail in Chapter 10.
For now, all you need to know is that <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> means the <code>Some</code> variant of the
<code>Option</code> enum can hold one piece of data of any type. Here are some examples of
using <code>Option</code> values to hold number types and string types:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let some_number = Some(5);
let some_string = Some(&quot;a string&quot;);

let absent_number: Option&lt;i32&gt; = None;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If we use <code>None</code> rather than <code>Some</code>, we need to tell Rust what type of
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> we have, because the compiler can’t infer the type that the <code>Some</code>
variant will hold by looking only at a <code>None</code> value.</p>
<p>When we have a <code>Some</code> value, we know that a value is present, and the value is
held within the <code>Some</code>. When we have a <code>None</code> value, in some sense, it means
the same thing as null: we don’t have a valid value. So why is having
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> any better than having null?</p>
<p>In short, because <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>T</code> (where <code>T</code> can be any type) are different
types, the compiler won’t let us use an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> value as if it was
definitely a valid value. For example, this code won’t compile because it’s
trying to add an <code>i8</code> to an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let x: i8 = 5;
let y: Option&lt;i8&gt; = Some(5);

let sum = x + y;
</code></pre>
<p>If we run this code, we get an error message like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0277]: the trait bound `i8: std::ops::Add&lt;std::option::Option&lt;i8&gt;&gt;` is
not satisfied
 --&gt;
  |
5 |     let sum = x + y;
  |                 ^ no implementation for `i8 + std::option::Option&lt;i8&gt;`
  |
</code></pre>
<p>Intense! In effect, this error message means that Rust doesn’t understand how
to add an <code>i8</code> and an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code>, because they’re different types. When we
have a value of a type like <code>i8</code> in Rust, the compiler will ensure that we
always have a valid value. We can proceed confidently without having to check
for null before using that value. Only when we have an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code> (or
whatever type of value we’re working with) do we have to worry about possibly
not having a value, and the compiler will make sure we handle that case before
using the value.</p>
<p>In other words, you have to convert an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> to a <code>T</code> before you can
perform <code>T</code> operations with it. Generally, this helps catch one of the most
common issues with null: assuming that something isn’t null when it actually
is.</p>
<p>Not having to worry about missing an assumption of having a not-null value
helps you to be more confident in your code. In order to have a value that can
possibly be null, you must explicitly opt in by making the type of that value
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>. Then, when you use that value, you are required to explicitly
handle the case when the value is null. Everywhere that a value has a type that
isn’t an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, you <em>can</em> safely assume that the value isn’t null. This
was a deliberate design decision for Rust to limit null’s pervasiveness and
increase the safety of Rust code.</p>
<p>So, how do you get the <code>T</code> value out of a <code>Some</code> variant when you have a value
of type <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> so you can use that value? The <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum has a large
number of methods that are useful in a variety of situations; you can check
them out in <a href="../../std/option/enum.Option.html">its documentation</a><!-- ignore -->. Becoming familiar with
the methods on <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> will be extremely useful in your journey with Rust.</p>
<p>In general, in order to use an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> value, we want to have code that
will handle each variant. We want some code that will run only when we have a
<code>Some(T)</code> value, and this code is allowed to use the inner <code>T</code>. We want some
other code to run if we have a <code>None</code> value, and that code doesn’t have a <code>T</code>
value available. The <code>match</code> expression is a control flow construct that does
just this when used with enums: it will run different code depending on which
variant of the enum it has, and that code can use the data inside the matching
value.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-match-control-flow-operator" id="the-match-control-flow-operator"><h2>The <code>match</code> Control Flow Operator</h2></a>
<p>Rust has an extremely powerful control-flow operator called <code>match</code> that allows
us to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based
on which pattern matches. Patterns can be made up of literal values, variable
names, wildcards, and many other things; Chapter 18 covers all the different
kinds of patterns and what they do. The power of <code>match</code> comes from the
expressiveness of the patterns and the compiler checks that all
possible cases are handled.</p>
<p>Think of a <code>match</code> expression kind of like a coin sorting machine: coins slide
down a track with variously sized holes along it, and each coin falls through
the first hole it encounters that it fits into. In the same way, values go
through each pattern in a <code>match</code>, and at the first pattern the value “fits,”
the value will fall into the associated code block to be used during execution.</p>
<p>Because we just mentioned coins, let’s use them as an example using <code>match</code>! We
can write a function that can take an unknown United States coin and, in a
similar way as the counting machine, determine which coin it is and return its
value in cents, as shown here in Listing 6-3:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -&gt; u32 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny =&gt; 1,
        Coin::Nickel =&gt; 5,
        Coin::Dime =&gt; 10,
        Coin::Quarter =&gt; 25,
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-3: An enum and a <code>match</code> expression that has
the variants of the enum as its patterns.</span></p>
<p>Let’s break down the <code>match</code> in the <code>value_in_cents</code> function. First, we list
the <code>match</code> keyword followed by an expression, which in this case is the value
<code>coin</code>. This seems very similar to an expression used with <code>if</code>, but there’s a
big difference: with <code>if</code>, the expression needs to return a Boolean value.
Here, it can be any type. The type of <code>coin</code> in this example is the <code>Coin</code> enum
that we defined in Listing 6-3.</p>
<p>Next are the <code>match</code> arms. An arm has two parts: a pattern and some code. The
first arm here has a pattern that is the value <code>Coin::Penny</code> and then the <code>=&gt;</code>
operator that separates the pattern and the code to run. The code in this case
is just the value <code>1</code>. Each arm is separated from the next with a comma.</p>
<p>When the <code>match</code> expression executes, it compares the resulting value against
the pattern of each arm, in order. If a pattern matches the value, the code
associated with that pattern is executed. If that pattern doesn’t match the
value, execution continues to the next arm, much like a coin sorting machine.
We can have as many arms as we need: in Listing 6-3, our <code>match</code> has four arms.</p>
<p>The code associated with each arm is an expression, and the resulting value of
the expression in the matching arm is the value that gets returned for the
entire <code>match</code> expression.</p>
<p>Curly brackets typically aren’t used if the match arm code is short, as it is
in Listing 6-3 where each arm just returns a value. If you want to run multiple
lines of code in a match arm, you can use curly brackets. For example, the
following code would print out “Lucky penny!” every time the method was called
with a <code>Coin::Penny</code> but would still return the last value of the block, <code>1</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# enum Coin {
#    Penny,
#    Nickel,
#    Dime,
#    Quarter,
# }
#
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -&gt; u32 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny =&gt; {
            println!(&quot;Lucky penny!&quot;);
            1
        },
        Coin::Nickel =&gt; 5,
        Coin::Dime =&gt; 10,
        Coin::Quarter =&gt; 25,
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#patterns-that-bind-to-values" id="patterns-that-bind-to-values"><h3>Patterns that Bind to Values</h3></a>
<p>Another useful feature of match arms is that they can bind to parts of the
values that match the pattern. This is how we can extract values out of enum
variants.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s change one of our enum variants to hold data inside it.
From 1999 through 2008, the United States minted quarters with different
designs for each of the 50 states on one side. No other coins got state
designs, so only quarters have this extra value. We can add this information to
our <code>enum</code> by changing the <code>Quarter</code> variant to include a <code>UsState</code> value stored
inside it, which we’ve done here in Listing 6-4:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Debug)] // So we can inspect the state in a minute
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    // ... etc
}

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState),
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-4: A <code>Coin</code> enum where the <code>Quarter</code> variant
also holds a <code>UsState</code> value</span></p>
<p>Let’s imagine that a friend of ours is trying to collect all 50 state quarters.
While we sort our loose change by coin type, we’ll also call out the name of
the state associated with each quarter so if it’s one our friend doesn’t have,
they can add it to their collection.</p>
<p>In the match expression for this code, we add a variable called <code>state</code> to the
pattern that matches values of the variant <code>Coin::Quarter</code>. When a
<code>Coin::Quarter</code> matches, the <code>state</code> variable will bind to the value of that
quarter’s state. Then we can use <code>state</code> in the code for that arm, like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# #[derive(Debug)]
# enum UsState {
#    Alabama,
#    Alaska,
# }
#
# enum Coin {
#    Penny,
#    Nickel,
#    Dime,
#    Quarter(UsState),
# }
#
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -&gt; u32 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny =&gt; 1,
        Coin::Nickel =&gt; 5,
        Coin::Dime =&gt; 10,
        Coin::Quarter(state) =&gt; {
            println!(&quot;State quarter from {:?}!&quot;, state);
            25
        },
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If we were to call <code>value_in_cents(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska))</code>, <code>coin</code>
would be <code>Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska)</code>. When we compare that value with each
of the match arms, none of them match until we reach <code>Coin::Quarter(state)</code>. At
that point, the binding for <code>state</code> will be the value <code>UsState::Alaska</code>. We can
then use that binding in the <code>println!</code> expression, thus getting the inner
state value out of the <code>Coin</code> enum variant for <code>Quarter</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#matching-with-optiont" id="matching-with-optiont"><h3>Matching with <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code></h3></a>
<p>In the previous section we wanted to get the inner <code>T</code> value out of the <code>Some</code>
case when using <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>; we can also handle <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> using <code>match</code> as we
did with the <code>Coin</code> enum! Instead of comparing coins, we’ll compare the
variants of <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, but the way that the <code>match</code> expression works remains
the same.</p>
<p>Let’s say we want to write a function that takes an <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code>, and if
there’s a value inside, adds one to that value. If there isn’t a value inside,
the function should return the <code>None</code> value and not attempt to perform any
operations.</p>
<p>This function is very easy to write, thanks to <code>match</code>, and will look like
Listing 6-5:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn plus_one(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {
    match x {
        None =&gt; None,
        Some(i) =&gt; Some(i + 1),
    }
}

let five = Some(5);
let six = plus_one(five);
let none = plus_one(None);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-5: A function that uses a <code>match</code> expression on
an <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code></span></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#matching-somet" id="matching-somet"><h4>Matching <code>Some(T)</code></h4></a>
<p>Let’s examine the first execution of <code>plus_one</code> in more detail. When we call
<code>plus_one(five)</code>, the variable <code>x</code> in the body of <code>plus_one</code> will have the
value <code>Some(5)</code>. We then compare that against each match arm.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">None =&gt; None,
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Some(5)</code> value doesn’t match the pattern <code>None</code>, so we continue to the
next arm.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">Some(i) =&gt; Some(i + 1),
</code></pre>
<p>Does <code>Some(5)</code> match <code>Some(i)</code>? Well yes it does! We have the same variant.
The <code>i</code> binds to the value contained in <code>Some</code>, so <code>i</code> takes the value <code>5</code>. The
code in the match arm is then executed, so we add one to the value of <code>i</code> and
create a new <code>Some</code> value with our total <code>6</code> inside.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#matching-none" id="matching-none"><h4>Matching <code>None</code></h4></a>
<p>Now let’s consider the second call of <code>plus_one</code> in Listing 6-5 where <code>x</code> is
<code>None</code>. We enter the <code>match</code> and compare to the first arm.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">None =&gt; None,
</code></pre>
<p>It matches! There’s no value to add to, so the program stops and returns the
<code>None</code> value on the right side of <code>=&gt;</code>. Because the first arm matched, no other
arms are compared.</p>
<p>Combining <code>match</code> and enums is useful in many situations. You’ll see this
pattern a lot in Rust code: <code>match</code> against an enum, bind a variable to the
data inside, and then execute code based on it. It’s a bit tricky at first, but
once you get used to it, you’ll wish you had it in all languages. It’s
consistently a user favorite.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#matches-are-exhaustive" id="matches-are-exhaustive"><h3>Matches Are Exhaustive</h3></a>
<p>There’s one other aspect of <code>match</code> we need to discuss. Consider this version
of our <code>plus_one</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn plus_one(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {
    match x {
        Some(i) =&gt; Some(i + 1),
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We didn’t handle the <code>None</code> case, so this code will cause a bug. Luckily, it’s
a bug Rust knows how to catch. If we try to compile this code, we’ll get this
error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `None` not covered
 --&gt;
  |
6 |         match x {
  |               ^ pattern `None` not covered
</code></pre>
<p>Rust knows that we didn’t cover every possible case and even knows which
pattern we forgot! Matches in Rust are <em>exhaustive</em>: we must exhaust every last
possibility in order for the code to be valid. Especially in the case of
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, when Rust prevents us from forgetting to explicitly handle the
<code>None</code> case, it protects us from assuming that we have a value when we might
have null, thus making the billion dollar mistake discussed earlier.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-_-placeholder" id="the-_-placeholder"><h3>The <code>_</code> Placeholder</h3></a>
<p>Rust also has a pattern we can use in situations when we don’t want to list all
possible values. For example, a <code>u8</code> can have valid values of 0 through 255. If
we only care about the values 1, 3, 5, and 7, we don’t want to have to list out
0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 all the way up to 255. Fortunately, we don’t have to: we can
use the special pattern <code>_</code> instead:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let some_u8_value = 0u8;
match some_u8_value {
    1 =&gt; println!(&quot;one&quot;),
    3 =&gt; println!(&quot;three&quot;),
    5 =&gt; println!(&quot;five&quot;),
    7 =&gt; println!(&quot;seven&quot;),
    _ =&gt; (),
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>_</code> pattern will match any value. By putting it after our other arms, the
<code>_</code> will match all the possible cases that aren’t specified before it. The <code>()</code>
is just the unit value, so nothing will happen in the <code>_</code> case. As a result, we
can say that we want to do nothing for all the possible values that we don’t
list before the <code>_</code> placeholder.</p>
<p>However, the <code>match</code> expression can be a bit wordy in a situation in which we
only care about <em>one</em> of the cases. For this situation, Rust provides <code>if let</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#concise-control-flow-with-if-let" id="concise-control-flow-with-if-let"><h2>Concise Control Flow with <code>if let</code></h2></a>
<p>The <code>if let</code> syntax lets you combine <code>if</code> and <code>let</code> into a less verbose way to
handle values that match one pattern and ignore the rest. Consider the program
in Listing 6-6 that matches on an <code>Option&lt;u8&gt;</code> value but only wants to execute
code if the value is three:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let some_u8_value = Some(0u8);
match some_u8_value {
    Some(3) =&gt; println!(&quot;three&quot;),
    _ =&gt; (),
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-6: A <code>match</code> that only cares about executing
code when the value is <code>Some(3)</code></span></p>
<p>We want to do something with the <code>Some(3)</code> match but do nothing with any other
<code>Some&lt;u8&gt;</code> value or the <code>None</code> value. To satisfy the <code>match</code> expression, we
have to add <code>_ =&gt; ()</code> after processing just one variant, which is a lot of
boilerplate code to add.</p>
<p>Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using <code>if let</code>. The following
code behaves the same as the <code>match</code> in Listing 6-6:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# let some_u8_value = Some(0u8);
if let Some(3) = some_u8_value {
    println!(&quot;three&quot;);
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><code>if let</code> takes a pattern and an expression separated by an <code>=</code>. It works the
same way as a <code>match</code>, where the expression is given to the <code>match</code> and the
pattern is its first arm.</p>
<p>Using <code>if let</code> means you have less to type, less indentation, and less
boilerplate code. However, we’ve lost the exhaustive checking that <code>match</code>
enforces. Choosing between <code>match</code> and <code>if let</code> depends on what you’re doing in
your particular situation and if gaining conciseness is an appropriate
trade-off for losing exhaustive checking.</p>
<p>In other words, you can think of <code>if let</code> as syntax sugar for a <code>match</code> that
runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values.</p>
<p>We can include an <code>else</code> with an <code>if let</code>. The block of code that goes with the
<code>else</code> is the same as the block of code that would go with the <code>_</code> case in the
<code>match</code> expression that is equivalent to the <code>if let</code> and <code>else</code>. Recall the
<code>Coin</code> enum definition in Listing 6-4, where the <code>Quarter</code> variant also held a
<code>UsState</code> value. If we wanted to count all non-quarter coins we see while also
announcing the state of the quarters, we could do that with a <code>match</code>
expression like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# #[derive(Debug)]
# enum UsState {
#    Alabama,
#    Alaska,
# }
#
# enum Coin {
#    Penny,
#    Nickel,
#    Dime,
#    Quarter(UsState),
# }
# let coin = Coin::Penny;
let mut count = 0;
match coin {
    Coin::Quarter(state) =&gt; println!(&quot;State quarter from {:?}!&quot;, state),
    _ =&gt; count += 1,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Or we could use an <code>if let</code> and <code>else</code> expression like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# #[derive(Debug)]
# enum UsState {
#    Alabama,
#    Alaska,
# }
#
# enum Coin {
#    Penny,
#    Nickel,
#    Dime,
#    Quarter(UsState),
# }
# let coin = Coin::Penny;
let mut count = 0;
if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
    println!(&quot;State quarter from {:?}!&quot;, state);
} else {
    count += 1;
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If you have a situation in which your program has logic that is too verbose to
express using a <code>match</code>, remember that <code>if let</code> is in your Rust toolbox as well.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#summary-4" id="summary-4"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>We’ve now covered how to use enums to create custom types that can be one of a
set of enumerated values. We’ve shown how the standard library’s <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>
type helps you use the type system to prevent errors. When enum values have
data inside them, you can use <code>match</code> or <code>if let</code> to extract and use those
values, depending on how many cases you need to handle.</p>
<p>Your Rust programs can now express concepts in your domain using structs and
enums. Creating custom types to use in your API ensures type safety: the
compiler will make certain your functions only get values of the type each
function expects.</p>
<p>In order to provide a well-organized API to your users that is straightforward
to use and only exposes exactly what your users will need, let’s now turn to
Rust’s modules.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-modules-to-reuse-and-organize-code" id="using-modules-to-reuse-and-organize-code"><h1>Using Modules to Reuse and Organize Code</h1></a>
<p>When you start writing programs in Rust, your code might live solely in the
<code>main</code> function. As your code grows, you’ll eventually move functionality into
other functions for reuse and better organization. By splitting your code into
smaller chunks, each chunk is easier to understand on its own. But what happens
if you have too many functions? Rust has a module system that enables the reuse
of code in an organized fashion.</p>
<p>In the same way that you extract lines of code into a function, you can extract
functions (and other code, like structs and enums) into different modules. A
<em>module</em> is a namespace that contains definitions of functions or types, and
you can choose whether those definitions are visible outside their module
(public) or not (private). Here’s an overview of how modules work:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>mod</code> keyword declares a new module. Code within the module appears
either immediately following this declaration within curly brackets or in
another file.</li>
<li>By default, functions, types, constants, and modules are private. The <code>pub</code>
keyword makes an item public and therefore visible outside its namespace.</li>
<li>The <code>use</code> keyword brings modules, or the definitions inside modules, into
scope so it’s easier to refer to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll look at each of these parts to see how they fit into the whole.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#mod-and-the-filesystem" id="mod-and-the-filesystem"><h2><code>mod</code> and the Filesystem</h2></a>
<p>We’ll start our module example by making a new project with Cargo, but instead
of creating a binary crate, we’ll make a library crate: a project that other
people can pull into their projects as a dependency. For example, the <code>rand</code>
crate discussed in Chapter 2 is a library crate that we used as a dependency in
the guessing game project.</p>
<p>We’ll create a skeleton of a library that provides some general networking
functionality; we’ll concentrate on the organization of the modules and
functions but we won’t worry about what code goes in the function bodies. We’ll
call our library <code>communicator</code>. By default, Cargo will create a library unless
another type of project is specified: if we omit the <code>--bin</code> option that we’ve
been using in all of the chapters preceding this one, our project will be a
library:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo new communicator
$ cd communicator
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that Cargo generated <em>src/lib.rs</em> instead of <em>src/main.rs</em>. Inside
<em>src/lib.rs</em> we’ll find the following:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Cargo creates an example test to help us get our library started, rather than
the “Hello, world!” binary that we get when we use the <code>--bin</code> option. We’ll
look at the <code>#[]</code> and <code>mod tests</code> syntax in the “Using <code>super</code> to Access a
Parent Module” section later in this chapter, but for now, leave this code at
the bottom of <em>src/lib.rs</em>.</p>
<p>Because we don’t have a <em>src/main.rs</em> file, there’s nothing for Cargo to
execute with the <code>cargo run</code> command. Therefore, we’ll use the <code>cargo build</code>
command to compile our library crate’s code.</p>
<p>We’ll look at different options for organizing your library’s code that will be
suitable in a variety of situations, depending on the intent of the code.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#module-definitions" id="module-definitions"><h3>Module Definitions</h3></a>
<p>For our <code>communicator</code> networking library, we’ll first define a module named
<code>network</code> that contains the definition of a function called <code>connect</code>. Every
module definition in Rust starts with the <code>mod</code> keyword. Add this code to the
beginning of the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file, above the test code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
mod network {
    fn connect() {
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>After the <code>mod</code> keyword, we put the name of the module, <code>network</code>, and then a
block of code in curly brackets. Everything inside this block is inside the
namespace <code>network</code>. In this case, we have a single function, <code>connect</code>. If we
wanted to call this function from code outside the <code>network</code> module, we
would need to specify the module and use the namespace syntax <code>::</code>, like so:
<code>network::connect()</code> rather than just <code>connect()</code>.</p>
<p>We can also have multiple modules, side by side, in the same <em>src/lib.rs</em> file.
For example, to also have a <code>client</code> module that has a function named <code>connect</code>
as well, we can add it as shown in Listing 7-1:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
mod network {
    fn connect() {
    }
}

mod client {
    fn connect() {
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-1: The <code>network</code> module and the <code>client</code> module
defined side by side in <em>src/lib.rs</em></span></p>
<p>Now we have a <code>network::connect</code> function and a <code>client::connect</code> function.
These can have completely different functionality, and the function names do
not conflict with each other because they’re in different modules.</p>
<p>In this case, because we’re building a library, the file that serves as the
entry point for building our library is <em>src/lib.rs</em>. However, in respect to
creating modules, there’s nothing special about <em>src/lib.rs</em>. We could also
create modules in <em>src/main.rs</em> for a binary crate in the same way as we’re
creating modules in <em>src/lib.rs</em> for the library crate. In fact, we can put
modules inside of modules, which can be useful as your modules grow to keep
related functionality organized together and separate functionality apart. The
choice of how you organize your code depends on how you think about the
relationship between the parts of your code. For instance, the <code>client</code> code
and its <code>connect</code> function might make more sense to users of our library if
they were inside the <code>network</code> namespace instead, as in Listing 7-2:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
mod network {
    fn connect() {
    }

    mod client {
        fn connect() {
        }
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-2: Moving the <code>client</code> module inside the
<code>network</code> module</span></p>
<p>In your <em>src/lib.rs</em> file, replace the existing <code>mod network</code> and <code>mod client</code>
definitions with the ones in Listing 7-2, which have the <code>client</code> module as an
inner module of <code>network</code>. Now we have the functions <code>network::connect</code> and
<code>network::client::connect</code>: again, the two functions named <code>connect</code> don’t
conflict with each other because they’re in different namespaces.</p>
<p>In this way, modules form a hierarchy. The contents of <em>src/lib.rs</em> are at the
topmost level, and the submodules are at lower levels. Here’s what the
organization of our example in Listing 7-1 looks like when thought of as a
hierarchy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">communicator
 ├── network
 └── client
</code></pre>
<p>And here’s the hierarchy corresponding to the example in Listing 7-2:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">communicator
 └── network
     └── client
</code></pre>
<p>The hierarchy shows that in Listing 7-2, <code>client</code> is a child of the <code>network</code>
module rather than a sibling. More complicated projects can have many modules,
and they’ll need to be organized logically in order to keep track of them. What
“logically” means in your project is up to you and depends on how you and your
library’s users think about your project’s domain. Use the techniques shown
here to create side-by-side modules and nested modules in whatever structure
you would like.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#moving-modules-to-other-files" id="moving-modules-to-other-files"><h3>Moving Modules to Other Files</h3></a>
<p>Modules form a hierarchical structure, much like another structure in computing
that you’re used to: filesystems! We can use Rust’s module system along with
multiple files to split up Rust projects so not everything lives in
<em>src/lib.rs</em> or <em>src/main.rs</em>. For this example, let’s start with the code in
Listing 7-3:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
mod client {
    fn connect() {
    }
}

mod network {
    fn connect() {
    }

    mod server {
        fn connect() {
        }
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-3: Three modules, <code>client</code>, <code>network</code>, and
<code>network::server</code>, all defined in <em>src/lib.rs</em></span></p>
<p>The file <em>src/lib.rs</em> has this module hierarchy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">communicator
 ├── client
 └── network
     └── server
</code></pre>
<p>If these modules had many functions, and those functions were becoming lengthy,
it would be difficult to scroll through this file to find the code we wanted to
work with. Because the functions are nested inside one or more <code>mod</code> blocks,
the lines of code inside the functions will start getting lengthy as well.
These would be good reasons to separate the <code>client</code>, <code>network</code>, and <code>server</code>
modules from <em>src/lib.rs</em> and place them into their own files.</p>
<p>First, replace the <code>client</code> module code with only the declaration of the
<code>client</code> module, so that your <em>src/lib.rs</em> looks like code shown in Listing 7-4:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">mod client;

mod network {
    fn connect() {
    }

    mod server {
        fn connect() {
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-4: Extracting the contents of the <code>client</code> module but leaving the declaration in <em>src/lib.rs</em></span></p>
<p>We’re still <em>declaring</em> the <code>client</code> module here, but by replacing the block
with a semicolon, we’re telling Rust to look in another location for the code
defined within the scope of the <code>client</code> module. In other words, the line <code>mod client;</code> means:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">mod client {
    // contents of client.rs
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to create the external file with that module name. Create a
<em>client.rs</em> file in your <em>src/</em> directory and open it. Then enter the
following, which is the <code>connect</code> function in the <code>client</code> module that we
removed in the previous step:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/client.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn connect() {
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that we don’t need a <code>mod</code> declaration in this file because we already
declared the <code>client</code> module with <code>mod</code> in <em>src/lib.rs</em>. This file just
provides the <em>contents</em> of the <code>client</code> module. If we put a <code>mod client</code> here,
we’d be giving the <code>client</code> module its own submodule named <code>client</code>!</p>
<p>Rust only knows to look in <em>src/lib.rs</em> by default. If we want to add more
files to our project, we need to tell Rust in <em>src/lib.rs</em> to look in other
files; this is why <code>mod client</code> needs to be defined in <em>src/lib.rs</em> and can’t
be defined in <em>src/client.rs</em>.</p>
<p>Now the project should compile successfully, although you’ll get a few
warnings. Remember to use <code>cargo build</code> instead of <code>cargo run</code> because we have
a library crate rather than a binary crate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build
   Compiling communicator v0.1.0 (file:///projects/communicator)

 --&gt; src/lib.rs:8:9
  |
8 | /         fn connect() {
9 | |         }
  | |_________^
</code></pre>
<p>These warnings tell us that we have functions that are never used. Don’t worry
about these warnings for now; we’ll address them later in this chapter in the
“Controlling Visibility with <code>pub</code>” section. The good news is that they’re just
warnings; our project built successfully!</p>
<p>Next, let’s extract the <code>network</code> module into its own file using the same
pattern. In <em>src/lib.rs</em>, delete the body of the <code>network</code> module and add a
semicolon to the declaration, like so:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">mod client;

mod network;
</code></pre>
<p>Then create a new <em>src/network.rs</em> file and enter the following:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/network.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn connect() {
}

mod server {
    fn connect() {
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Notice that we still have a <code>mod</code> declaration within this module file; this is
because we still want <code>server</code> to be a submodule of <code>network</code>.</p>
<p>Run <code>cargo build</code> again. Success! We have one more module to extract: <code>server</code>.
Because it’s a submodule—that is, a module within a module—our current tactic
of extracting a module into a file named after that module won’t work. We’ll
try anyway so you can see the error. First, change <em>src/network.rs</em> to have
<code>mod server;</code> instead of the <code>server</code> module’s contents:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/network.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn connect() {
}

mod server;
</code></pre>
<p>Then create a <em>src/server.rs</em> file and enter the contents of the <code>server</code>
module that we extracted:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/server.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn connect() {
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>When we try to <code>cargo build</code>, we’ll get the error shown in Listing 7-5:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build

</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-5: Error when trying to extract the <code>server</code>
submodule into <em>src/server.rs</em></span></p>
<p>The error says we <code>cannot declare a new module at this location</code> and is
pointing to the <code>mod server;</code> line in <em>src/network.rs</em>. So <em>src/network.rs</em> is
different than <em>src/lib.rs</em> somehow: keep reading to understand why.</p>
<p>The note in the middle of Listing 7-5 is actually very helpful because it
points out something we haven’t yet talked about doing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">note: maybe move this module `network` to its own directory via
`network/mod.rs`
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of continuing to follow the same file naming pattern we used
previously, we can do what the note suggests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a new <em>directory</em> named <em>network</em>, the parent module’s name.</li>
<li>Move the <em>src/network.rs</em> file into the new <em>network</em> directory, and
rename it to <em>src/network/mod.rs</em>.</li>
<li>Move the submodule file <em>src/server.rs</em> into the <em>network</em> directory.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are commands to carry out these steps:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ mkdir src/network
$ mv src/network.rs src/network/mod.rs
$ mv src/server.rs src/network
</code></pre>
<p>Now when we try to run <code>cargo build</code>, compilation will work (we’ll still have
warnings though). Our module layout still looks like this, which is exactly the
same as it did when we had all the code in <em>src/lib.rs</em> in Listing 7-3:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">communicator
 ├── client
 └── network
     └── server
</code></pre>
<p>The corresponding file layout now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">├── src
│   ├── client.rs
│   ├── lib.rs
│   └── network
│       ├── mod.rs
│       └── server.rs
</code></pre>
<p>So when we wanted to extract the <code>network::server</code> module, why did we have to
also change the <em>src/network.rs</em> file to the <em>src/network/mod.rs</em> file and put
the code for <code>network::server</code> in the <em>network</em> directory in
<em>src/network/server.rs</em> instead of just being able to extract the
<code>network::server</code> module into <em>src/server.rs</em>? The reason is that Rust wouldn’t
be able to recognize that <code>server</code> was supposed to be a submodule of <code>network</code>
if the <em>server.rs</em> file was in the <em>src</em> directory. To clarify Rust’s behavior
here, let’s consider a different example with the following module hierarchy,
where all the definitions are in <em>src/lib.rs</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">communicator
 ├── client
 └── network
     └── client
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we have three modules again: <code>client</code>, <code>network</code>, and
<code>network::client</code>. Following the same steps we did earlier for extracting
modules into files, we would create <em>src/client.rs</em> for the <code>client</code> module.
For the <code>network</code> module, we would create <em>src/network.rs</em>. But we wouldn’t be
able to extract the <code>network::client</code> module into a <em>src/client.rs</em> file
because that already exists for the top-level <code>client</code> module! If we could put
the code for <em>both</em> the <code>client</code> and <code>network::client</code> modules in the
<em>src/client.rs</em> file, Rust wouldn’t have any way to know whether the code was
for <code>client</code> or for <code>network::client</code>.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to extract a file for the <code>network::client</code> submodule of
the <code>network</code> module, we needed to create a directory for the <code>network</code> module
instead of a <em>src/network.rs</em> file. The code that is in the <code>network</code> module
then goes into the <em>src/network/mod.rs</em> file, and the submodule
<code>network::client</code> can have its own <em>src/network/client.rs</em> file. Now the
top-level <em>src/client.rs</em> is unambiguously the code that belongs to the
<code>client</code> module.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#rules-of-module-filesystems" id="rules-of-module-filesystems"><h3>Rules of Module Filesystems</h3></a>
<p>Let’s summarize the rules of modules with regard to files:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a module named <code>foo</code> has no submodules, you should put the declarations
for <code>foo</code> in a file named <em>foo.rs</em>.</li>
<li>If a module named <code>foo</code> does have submodules, you should put the declarations
for <code>foo</code> in a file named <em>foo/mod.rs</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules apply recursively, so if a module named <code>foo</code> has a submodule named
<code>bar</code> and <code>bar</code> does not have submodules, you should have the following files
in your <em>src</em> directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">├── foo
│   ├── bar.rs (contains the declarations in `foo::bar`)
│   └── mod.rs (contains the declarations in `foo`, including `mod bar`)
</code></pre>
<p>The modules should be declared in their parent module’s file using the <code>mod</code>
keyword.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll talk about the <code>pub</code> keyword and get rid of those warnings!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#controlling-visibility-with-pub" id="controlling-visibility-with-pub"><h2>Controlling Visibility with <code>pub</code></h2></a>
<p>We resolved the error messages shown in Listing 7-5 by moving the <code>network</code> and
<code>network::server</code> code into the <em>src/network/mod.rs</em> and
<em>src/network/server.rs</em> files, respectively. At that point, <code>cargo build</code> was
able to build our project, but we still get warning messages about the
<code>client::connect</code>, <code>network::connect</code>, and <code>network::server::connect</code> functions
not being used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">warning: function is never used: `connect`
 --&gt; src/client.rs:1:1
  |
1 | / fn connect() {
2 | | }
  | |_^
  |
  = note: #[warn(dead_code)] on by default

warning: function is never used: `connect`
 --&gt; src/network/mod.rs:1:1
  |
1 | / fn connect() {
2 | | }
  | |_^

warning: function is never used: `connect`
 --&gt; src/network/server.rs:1:1
  |
1 | / fn connect() {
2 | | }
  | |_^
</code></pre>
<p>So why are we receiving these warnings? After all, we’re building a library
with functions that are intended to be used by our <em>users</em>, not necessarily by
us within our own project, so it shouldn’t matter that these <code>connect</code>
functions go unused. The point of creating them is that they will be used by
another project, not our own.</p>
<p>To understand why this program invokes these warnings, let’s try using the
<code>connect</code> library from another project, calling it externally. To do that,
we’ll create a binary crate in the same directory as our library crate by
making a <em>src/main.rs</em> file containing this code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate communicator;

fn main() {
    communicator::client::connect();
}
</code></pre>
<p>We use the <code>extern crate</code> command to bring the <code>communicator</code> library crate
into scope. Our package now contains <em>two</em> crates. Cargo treats <em>src/main.rs</em>
as the root file of a binary crate, which is separate from the existing library
crate whose root file is <em>src/lib.rs</em>. This pattern is quite common for
executable projects: most functionality is in a library crate, and the binary
crate uses that library crate. As a result, other programs can also use the
library crate, and it’s a nice separation of concerns.</p>
<p>From the point of view of a crate outside the <code>communicator</code> library looking
in, all the modules we’ve been creating are within a module that has the same
name as the crate, <code>communicator</code>. We call the top-level module of a crate the
<em>root module</em>.</p>
<p>Also note that even if we’re using an external crate within a submodule of our
project, the <code>extern crate</code> should go in our root module (so in <em>src/main.rs</em>
or <em>src/lib.rs</em>). Then, in our submodules, we can refer to items from external
crates as if the items are top-level modules.</p>
<p>Right now, our binary crate just calls our library’s <code>connect</code> function from
the <code>client</code> module. However, invoking <code>cargo build</code> will now give us an error
after the warnings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0603]: module `client` is private
 --&gt; src/main.rs:4:5
  |
4 |     communicator::client::connect();
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>
<p>Ah ha! This error tells us that the <code>client</code> module is private, which is the
crux of the warnings. It’s also the first time we’ve run into the concepts of
<em>public</em> and <em>private</em> in the context of Rust. The default state of all code in
Rust is private: no one else is allowed to use the code. If you don’t use a
private function within your program, because your program is the only code
allowed to use that function, Rust will warn you that the function has gone
unused.</p>
<p>After we specify that a function like <code>client::connect</code> is public, not only
will our call to that function from our binary crate be allowed, but the
warning that the function is unused will go away. Marking a function as public
lets Rust know that the function will be used by code outside of our program.
Rust considers the theoretical external usage that’s now possible as the
function “being used.” Thus, when a function is marked public, Rust will not
require that it be used in our program and will stop warning that the function
is unused.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#making-a-function-public" id="making-a-function-public"><h3>Making a Function Public</h3></a>
<p>To tell Rust to make a function public, we add the <code>pub</code> keyword to the start
of the declaration. We’ll focus on fixing the warning that indicates
<code>client::connect</code> has gone unused for now, as well as the <code>module `client` is private</code> error from our binary crate. Modify <em>src/lib.rs</em> to make the
<code>client</code> module public, like so:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub mod client;

mod network;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pub</code> keyword is placed right before <code>mod</code>. Let’s try building again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0603]: function `connect` is private
 --&gt; src/main.rs:4:5
  |
4 |     communicator::client::connect();
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>
<p>Hooray! We have a different error! Yes, different error messages are a cause
for celebration. The new error shows <code>function `connect` is private</code>, so
let’s edit <em>src/client.rs</em> to make <code>client::connect</code> public too:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/client.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub fn connect() {
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Now run <code>cargo build</code> again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">warning: function is never used: `connect`
 --&gt; src/network/mod.rs:1:1
  |
1 | / fn connect() {
2 | | }
  | |_^
  |
  = note: #[warn(dead_code)] on by default

warning: function is never used: `connect`
 --&gt; src/network/server.rs:1:1
  |
1 | / fn connect() {
2 | | }
  | |_^
</code></pre>
<p>The code compiled, and the warning about <code>client::connect</code> not being used is
gone!</p>
<p>Unused code warnings don’t always indicate that an item in your code needs to
be made public: if you <em>didn’t</em> want these functions to be part of your public
API, unused code warnings could be alerting you to code you no longer need that
you can safely delete. They could also be alerting you to a bug if you had just
accidentally removed all places within your library where this function is
called.</p>
<p>But in this case, we <em>do</em> want the other two functions to be part of our
crate’s public API, so let’s mark them as <code>pub</code> as well to get rid of the
remaining warnings. Modify <em>src/network/mod.rs</em> to look like the following:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/network/mod.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn connect() {
}

mod server;
</code></pre>
<p>Then compile the code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">warning: function is never used: `connect`
 --&gt; src/network/mod.rs:1:1
  |
1 | / pub fn connect() {
2 | | }
  | |_^
  |
  = note: #[warn(dead_code)] on by default

warning: function is never used: `connect`
 --&gt; src/network/server.rs:1:1
  |
1 | / fn connect() {
2 | | }
  | |_^
</code></pre>
<p>Hmmm, we’re still getting an unused function warning, even though
<code>network::connect</code> is set to <code>pub</code>. The reason is that the function is public
within the module, but the <code>network</code> module that the function resides in is not
public. We’re working from the interior of the library out this time, whereas
with <code>client::connect</code> we worked from the outside in. We need to change
<em>src/lib.rs</em> to make <code>network</code> public too, like so:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub mod client;

pub mod network;
</code></pre>
<p>Now when we compile, that warning is gone:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">warning: function is never used: `connect`
 --&gt; src/network/server.rs:1:1
  |
1 | / fn connect() {
2 | | }
  | |_^
  |
  = note: #[warn(dead_code)] on by default
</code></pre>
<p>Only one warning is left! Try to fix this one on your own!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#privacy-rules" id="privacy-rules"><h3>Privacy Rules</h3></a>
<p>Overall, these are the rules for item visibility:</p>
<ol>
<li>If an item is public, it can be accessed through any of its parent modules.</li>
<li>If an item is private, it can be accessed only by its immediate parent
module and any of the parent’s child modules.</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="print.html#privacy-examples" id="privacy-examples"><h3>Privacy Examples</h3></a>
<p>Let’s look at a few more privacy examples to get some practice. Create a new
library project and enter the code in Listing 7-6 into your new project’s
<em>src/lib.rs</em>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">mod outermost {
    pub fn middle_function() {}

    fn middle_secret_function() {}

    mod inside {
        pub fn inner_function() {}

        fn secret_function() {}
    }
}

fn try_me() {
    outermost::middle_function();
    outermost::middle_secret_function();
    outermost::inside::inner_function();
    outermost::inside::secret_function();
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-6: Examples of private and public functions,
some of which are incorrect</span></p>
<p>Before you try to compile this code, make a guess about which lines in the
<code>try_me</code> function will have errors. Then, try compiling the code to see whether
you were right, and read on for the discussion of the errors!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#looking-at-the-errors" id="looking-at-the-errors"><h4>Looking at the Errors</h4></a>
<p>The <code>try_me</code> function is in the root module of our project. The module named
<code>outermost</code> is private, but the second privacy rule states that the <code>try_me</code>
function is allowed to access the <code>outermost</code> module because <code>outermost</code> is in
the current (root) module, as is <code>try_me</code>.</p>
<p>The call to <code>outermost::middle_function</code> will work because <code>middle_function</code> is
public, and <code>try_me</code> is accessing <code>middle_function</code> through its parent module
<code>outermost</code>. We determined in the previous paragraph that this module is
accessible.</p>
<p>The call to <code>outermost::middle_secret_function</code> will cause a compilation error.
<code>middle_secret_function</code> is private, so the second rule applies. The root
module is neither the current module of <code>middle_secret_function</code> (<code>outermost</code>
is), nor is it a child module of the current module of <code>middle_secret_function</code>.</p>
<p>The module named <code>inside</code> is private and has no child modules, so it can only
be accessed by its current module <code>outermost</code>. That means the <code>try_me</code> function
is not allowed to call <code>outermost::inside::inner_function</code> or
<code>outermost::inside::secret_function</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#fixing-the-errors" id="fixing-the-errors"><h4>Fixing the Errors</h4></a>
<p>Here are some suggestions for changing the code in an attempt to fix the
errors. Before you try each one, make a guess as to whether it will fix the
errors, and then compile the code to see whether or not you’re right, using the
privacy rules to understand why.</p>
<ul>
<li>What if the <code>inside</code> module was public?</li>
<li>What if <code>outermost</code> was public and <code>inside</code> was private?</li>
<li>What if, in the body of <code>inner_function</code>, you called
<code>::outermost::middle_secret_function()</code>? (The two colons at the beginning mean
that we want to refer to the modules starting from the root module.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to design more experiments and try them out!</p>
<p>Next, let’s talk about bringing items into scope with the <code>use</code> keyword.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#referring-to-names-in-different-modules" id="referring-to-names-in-different-modules"><h2>Referring to Names in Different Modules</h2></a>
<p>We’ve covered how to call functions defined within a module using the module
name as part of the call, as in the call to the <code>nested_modules</code> function shown
here in Listing 7-7:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">pub mod a {
    pub mod series {
        pub mod of {
            pub fn nested_modules() {}
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    a::series::of::nested_modules();
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-7: Calling a function by fully specifying its
enclosing module’s path</span></p>
<p>As you can see, referring to the fully qualified name can get quite lengthy.
Fortunately, Rust has a keyword to make these calls more concise.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#bringing-names-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword" id="bringing-names-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword"><h3>Bringing Names into Scope with the <code>use</code> Keyword</h3></a>
<p>Rust’s <code>use</code> keyword shortens lengthy function calls by bringing the modules of
the function you want to call into scope. Here’s an example of bringing the
<code>a::series::of</code> module into a binary crate’s root scope:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">pub mod a {
    pub mod series {
        pub mod of {
            pub fn nested_modules() {}
        }
    }
}

use a::series::of;

fn main() {
    of::nested_modules();
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The line <code>use a::series::of;</code> means that rather than using the full
<code>a::series::of</code> path wherever we want to refer to the <code>of</code> module, we can use
<code>of</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>use</code> keyword brings only what we’ve specified into scope: it does not
bring children of modules into scope. That’s why we still have to use
<code>of::nested_modules</code> when we want to call the <code>nested_modules</code> function.</p>
<p>We could have chosen to bring the function into scope by instead specifying the
function in the <code>use</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">pub mod a {
    pub mod series {
        pub mod of {
            pub fn nested_modules() {}
        }
    }
}

use a::series::of::nested_modules;

fn main() {
    nested_modules();
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Doing so allows us to exclude all the modules and reference the function
directly.</p>
<p>Because enums also form a sort of namespace like modules, we can bring an
enum’s variants into scope with <code>use</code> as well. For any kind of <code>use</code> statement,
if you’re bringing multiple items from one namespace into scope, you can list
them using curly brackets and commas in the last position, like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">enum TrafficLight {
    Red,
    Yellow,
    Green,
}

use TrafficLight::{Red, Yellow};

fn main() {
    let red = Red;
    let yellow = Yellow;
    let green = TrafficLight::Green;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>We’re still specifying the <code>TrafficLight</code> namespace for the <code>Green</code> variant
because we didn’t include <code>Green</code> in the <code>use</code> statement.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#bringing-all-names-into-scope-with-a-glob" id="bringing-all-names-into-scope-with-a-glob"><h3>Bringing All Names into Scope with a Glob</h3></a>
<p>To bring all the items in a namespace into scope at once, we can use the <code>*</code>  syntax, which is called the <em>glob operator</em>. This example brings all the variants of an enum into scope without having to list each specifically:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">enum TrafficLight {
    Red,
    Yellow,
    Green,
}

use TrafficLight::*;

fn main() {
    let red = Red;
    let yellow = Yellow;
    let green = Green;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>*</code> will bring into scope all the visible items in the <code>TrafficLight</code>
namespace. You should use globs sparingly: they are convenient, but this might
also pull in more items than you expected and cause naming conflicts.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-super-to-access-a-parent-module" id="using-super-to-access-a-parent-module"><h3>Using <code>super</code> to Access a Parent Module</h3></a>
<p>As we saw at the beginning of this chapter, when you create a library crate,
Cargo makes a <code>tests</code> module for you. Let’s go into more detail about that now.
In your <code>communicator</code> project, open <em>src/lib.rs</em>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub mod client;

pub mod network;

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Chapter 11 explains more about testing, but parts of this example should make
sense now: we have a module named <code>tests</code> that lives next to our other modules
and contains one function named <code>it_works</code>. Even though there are special
annotations, the <code>tests</code> module is just another module! So our module hierarchy
looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">communicator
 ├── client
 ├── network
 |   └── client
 └── tests
</code></pre>
<p>Tests are for exercising the code within our library, so let’s try to call our
<code>client::connect</code> function from this <code>it_works</code> function, even though we won’t
be checking any functionality right now. This won’t work yet:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        client::connect();
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Run the tests by invoking the <code>cargo test</code> command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo test
   Compiling communicator v0.1.0 (file:///projects/communicator)
error[E0433]: failed to resolve. Use of undeclared type or module `client`
 --&gt; src/lib.rs:9:9
  |
9 |         client::connect();
  |         ^^^^^^ Use of undeclared type or module `client`
</code></pre>
<p>The compilation failed, but why? We don’t need to place <code>communicator::</code> in
front of the function like we did in <em>src/main.rs</em> because we are definitely
within the <code>communicator</code> library crate here. The reason is that paths are
always relative to the current module, which here is <code>tests</code>. The only
exception is in a <code>use</code> statement, where paths are relative to the crate root
by default. Our <code>tests</code> module needs the <code>client</code> module in its scope!</p>
<p>So how do we get back up one module in the module hierarchy to call the
<code>client::connect</code> function in the <code>tests</code> module? In the <code>tests</code> module, we can
either use leading colons to let Rust know that we want to start from the root
and list the whole path, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">::client::connect();
</code></pre>
<p>Or, we can use <code>super</code> to move up one module in the hierarchy from our current
module, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">super::client::connect();
</code></pre>
<p>These two options don’t look that different in this example, but if you’re
deeper in a module hierarchy, starting from the root every time would make your
code lengthy. In those cases, using <code>super</code> to get from the current module to
sibling modules is a good shortcut. Plus, if you’ve specified the path from the
root in many places in your code and then you rearrange your modules by moving
a subtree to another place, you’d end up needing to update the path in several
places, which would be tedious.</p>
<p>It would also be annoying to have to type <code>super::</code> in each test, but you’ve
already seen the tool for that solution: <code>use</code>! The <code>super::</code> functionality
changes the path you give to <code>use</code> so it is relative to the parent module
instead of to the root module.</p>
<p>For these reasons, in the <code>tests</code> module especially, <code>use super::something</code> is
usually the best solution. So now our test looks like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::client;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        client::connect();
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>When we run <code>cargo test</code> again, the test will pass and the first part of the
test result output will be the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo test

<p>Now you know some new techniques for organizing your code! Use these techniques
to group related functionality together, keep files from becoming too long, and
present a tidy public API to your library users.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll look at some collection data structures in the standard library
that you can use in your nice, neat code!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#common-collections" id="common-collections"><h1>Common Collections</h1></a>
<p>Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called
<em>collections</em>. Most other data types represent one specific value, but
collections can contain multiple values. Unlike the built-in array and tuple
types, the data these collections point to is stored on the heap, which means
the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow or
shrink as the program runs. Each kind of collection has different capabilities
and costs, and choosing an appropriate one for your current situation is a
skill you’ll develop over time. In this chapter, we’ll discuss three
collections that are used very often in Rust programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>vector</em> allows us to store a variable number of values next to each other.</li>
<li>A <em>string</em> is a collection of characters. We’ve discussed the <code>String</code> type
previously, but in this chapter we’ll talk about it in depth.</li>
<li>A <em>hash map</em> allows us to associate a value with a particular key. It’s a
particular implementation of the more general data structure called a <em>map</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn about the other kinds of collections provided by the standard library,
see <a href="../../std/collections/index.html">the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss how to create and update vectors, strings, and hash maps, as well
as what makes each special.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#vectors-store-lists-of-values" id="vectors-store-lists-of-values"><h2>Vectors Store Lists of Values</h2></a>
<p>The first collection type we’ll look at is <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, also known as a <em>vector</em>.
Vectors allow us to store more than one value in a single data structure that
puts all the values next to each other in memory. Vectors can only store values
of the same type. They are useful in situations in which you have a list of
items, such as the lines of text in a file or the prices of items in a shopping
cart.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-a-new-vector" id="creating-a-new-vector"><h3>Creating a New Vector</h3></a>
<p>To create a new, empty vector, we can call the <code>Vec::new</code> function as shown in
Listing 8-1:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let v: Vec&lt;i32&gt; = Vec::new();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-1: Creating a new, empty vector to hold values
of type <code>i32</code></span></p>
<p>Note that we added a type annotation here. Because we aren’t inserting any
values into this vector, Rust doesn’t know what kind of elements we intend to
store. This is an important point. Vectors are implemented using generics;
we’ll cover how to use generics with your own types in Chapter 10. For now,
know that the <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> type provided by the standard library can hold any type,
and when a specific vector holds a specific type, the type is specified within
angle brackets. In Listing 8-1, we’ve told Rust that the <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> in <code>v</code> will
hold elements of the <code>i32</code> type.</p>
<p>In more realistic code, Rust can often infer the type of value we want to store
once we insert values, so you rarely need to do this type annotation. It’s more
common to create a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> that has initial values, and Rust provides the
<code>vec!</code> macro for convenience. The macro will create a new vector that holds the
values we give it. Listing 8-2 creates a new <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> that holds the values
<code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-2: Creating a new vector containing
values</span></p>
<p>Because we’ve given initial <code>i32</code> values, Rust can infer that the type of <code>v</code>
is <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code>, and the type annotation isn’t necessary. Next, we’ll look at how
to modify a vector.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#updating-a-vector" id="updating-a-vector"><h3>Updating a Vector</h3></a>
<p>To create a vector and then add elements to it, we can use the <code>push</code> method as
shown in Listing 8-3:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut v = Vec::new();

v.push(5);
v.push(6);
v.push(7);
v.push(8);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-3: Using the <code>push</code> method to add values to a
vector</span></p>
<p>As with any variable, as discussed in Chapter 3, if we want to be able to
change its value, we need to make it mutable using the <code>mut</code> keyword. The
numbers we place inside are all of type <code>i32</code>, and Rust infers this from the
data, so we don’t need the <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> annotation.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dropping-a-vector-drops-its-elements" id="dropping-a-vector-drops-its-elements"><h3>Dropping a Vector Drops Its Elements</h3></a>
<p>Like any other <code>struct</code>, a vector will be freed when it goes out of scope, as
annotated in Listing 8-4:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
{
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];

    // do stuff with v

} // &lt;- v goes out of scope and is freed here
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-4: Showing where the vector and its elements
are dropped</span></p>
<p>When the vector gets dropped, all of its contents will also be dropped, meaning
those integers it holds will be cleaned up. This may seem like a
straightforward point but can get a bit more complicated when we start to
introduce references to the elements of the vector. Let’s tackle that next!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#reading-elements-of-vectors" id="reading-elements-of-vectors"><h3>Reading Elements of Vectors</h3></a>
<p>Now that you know how to create, update, and destroy vectors, knowing how to
read their contents is a good next step. There are two ways to reference a
value stored in a vector. In the examples, we’ve annotated the types of the
values that are returned from these functions for extra clarity.</p>
<p>Listing 8-5 shows both methods of accessing a value in a vector either with
indexing syntax or the <code>get</code> method:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let third: &amp;i32 = &amp;v[2];
let third: Option&lt;&amp;i32&gt; = v.get(2);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-5: Using indexing syntax or the <code>get</code> method to
access an item in a vector</span></p>
<p>Note two details here. First, we use the index value of <code>2</code> to get the third
element: vectors are indexed by number, starting at zero. Second, the two
different ways to get the third element are by using <code>&amp;</code> and <code>[]</code>, which gives
us a reference, or by using the <code>get</code> method with the index passed as an
argument, which gives us an <code>Option&lt;&amp;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The reason Rust has two ways to reference an element is so you can choose how
the program behaves when you try to use an index value that the vector doesn’t
have an element for. As an example, let’s see what a program will do if it has
a vector that holds five elements and then tries to access an element at index
100, as shown in Listing 8-6:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust should_panic">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let does_not_exist = &amp;v[100];

<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-6: Attempting to access the element at index
100 in a vector containing 5 elements</span></p>
<p>When you run this code, the first <code>[]</code> method will cause a <code>panic!</code> because it
references a nonexistent element. This method is best used when you want your
program to consider an attempt to access an element past the end of the vector
to be a fatal error that crashes the program.</p>
<p>When the <code>get</code> method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it returns
<code>None</code> without panicking. You would use this method if accessing an element
beyond the range of the vector happens occasionally under normal circumstances.
Your code will then have logic to handle having either <code>Some(&amp;element)</code> or
<code>None</code>, as discussed in Chapter 6. For example, the index could be coming from
a person entering a number. If they accidentally enter a number that’s too
large and the program gets a <code>None</code> value, you could tell the user how many
items are in the current vector and give them another chance to enter a valid
value. That would be more user-friendly than crashing the program due to a typo!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#invalid-references" id="invalid-references"><h4>Invalid References</h4></a>
<p>When the program has a valid reference, the borrow checker enforces the
ownership and borrowing rules (covered in Chapter 4) to ensure this reference
and any other references to the contents of the vector remain valid. Recall the
rule that states we can’t have mutable and immutable references in the same
scope. That rule applies in Listing 8-7 where we hold an immutable reference to
the first element in a vector and try to add an element to the end, which won’t
work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let first = &amp;v[0];

v.push(6);
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-7: Attempting to add an element to a vector
while holding a reference to an item</span></p>
<p>Compiling this code will result in this error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0502]: cannot borrow `v` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --&gt;
  |
4 |     let first = &amp;v[0];
  |                  - immutable borrow occurs here
5 |
6 |     v.push(6);
  |     ^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 |
8 | }
  | - immutable borrow ends here
</code></pre>
<p>The code in Listing 8-7 might look like it should work: why should a reference
to the first element care about what changes at the end of the vector? The
reason behind this error is due to the way vectors work: adding a new element
onto the end of the vector might require allocating new memory and copying the
old elements to the new space if there isn’t enough room to put all the
elements next to each other where the vector was. In that case, the reference
to the first element would be pointing to deallocated memory. The borrowing
rules prevent programs from ending up in that situation.</p>

<p>If we want to access each element in a vector in turn, we can iterate through
all of the elements rather than use indexes to access one at a time. Listing
8-8 shows how to use a <code>for</code> loop to get immutable references to each element
in a vector of <code>i32</code> values and print them out:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &amp;v {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, i);
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-8: Printing each element in a vector by
iterating over the elements using a <code>for</code> loop</span></p>
<p>We can also iterate over mutable references to each element in a mutable vector
in order to make changes to all the elements. The <code>for</code> loop in Listing 8-9
will add <code>50</code> to each element:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &amp;mut v {
    *i += 50;
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-9: Iterating over mutable references to
elements in a vector</span></p>
<p>To change the value that the mutable reference refers to, we have to use the
dereference operator (<code>*</code>) to get to the value in <code>i</code> before we can use the
<code>+=</code> operator .</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-an-enum-to-store-multiple-types" id="using-an-enum-to-store-multiple-types"><h3>Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types</h3></a>
<p>At the beginning of this chapter, we said that vectors can only store values
that are the same type. This can be inconvenient; there are definitely use
cases for needing to store a list of items of different types. Fortunately, the
variants of an enum are defined under the same enum type, so when we need to
store elements of a different type in a vector, we can define and use an enum!</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we want to get values from a row in a spreadsheet where
some of the columns in the row contain integers, some floating-point numbers,
and some strings. We can define an enum whose variants will hold the different
value types, and then all the enum variants will be considered the same type:
that of the enum. Then we can create a vector that holds that enum and so,
ultimately, holds different types. We’ve demonstrated this in Listing 8-10:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum SpreadsheetCell {
    Int(i32),
    Float(f64),
    Text(String),
}

let row = vec![
    SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
    SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from(&quot;blue&quot;)),
    SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
];
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-10: Defining an <code>enum</code> to store values of
different types in one vector</span></p>
<p>The reason Rust needs to know what types will be in the vector at compile time
is so it knows exactly how much memory on the heap will be needed to store each
element. A secondary advantage is that we can be explicit about what types are
allowed in this vector. If Rust allowed a vector to hold any type, there would
be a chance that one or more of the types would cause errors with the
operations performed on the elements of the vector. Using an enum plus a
<code>match</code> expression means that Rust will ensure at compile time that we always
handle every possible case, as discussed in Chapter 6.</p>
<p>If you don’t know the exhaustive set of types the program will get at runtime
to store in a vector when you’re writing a program, the enum technique won’t
work. Instead, you can use a trait object, which we’ll cover in Chapter 17.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve discussed some of the most common ways to use vectors, be sure
to review the API documentation for all the many useful methods defined on
<code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> by the standard library. For example, in addition to <code>push</code>, a <code>pop</code>
method removes and returns the last element. Let’s move on to the next
collection type: <code>String</code>!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#strings-store-utf-8-encoded-text" id="strings-store-utf-8-encoded-text"><h2>Strings Store UTF-8 Encoded Text</h2></a>
<p>We talked about strings in Chapter 4, but we’ll look at them in more depth now.
New Rustaceans commonly get stuck on strings due to a combination of three
concepts: Rust’s propensity for exposing possible errors, strings being a more
complicated data structure than many programmers give them credit for, and
UTF-8. These concepts combine in a way that can seem difficult when you’re
coming from other programming languages.</p>
<p>This discussion of strings is in the collections chapter because strings are
implemented as a collection of bytes plus some methods to provide useful
functionality when those bytes are interpreted as text. In this section, we’ll
talk about the operations on <code>String</code> that every collection type has, such as
creating, updating, and reading. We’ll also discuss the ways in which <code>String</code>
is different than the other collections, namely how indexing into a <code>String</code> is
complicated by the differences between how people and computers interpret
<code>String</code> data.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#what-is-a-string" id="what-is-a-string"><h3>What Is a String?</h3></a>
<p>We’ll first define what we mean by the term <em>string</em>. Rust has only one string
type in the core language, which is the string slice <code>str</code> that is usually seen
in its borrowed form <code>&amp;str</code>. In Chapter 4, we talked about <em>string slices</em>,
which are references to some UTF-8 encoded string data stored elsewhere. String
literals, for example, are stored in the binary output of the program and are
therefore string slices.</p>
<p>The <code>String</code> type is provided in Rust’s standard library rather than coded into
the core language and is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type.
When Rustaceans refer to “strings” in Rust, they usually mean the <code>String</code> and
the string slice <code>&amp;str</code> types, not just one of those types. Although this
section is largely about <code>String</code>, both types are used heavily in Rust’s
standard library and both <code>String</code> and string slices are UTF-8 encoded.</p>
<p>Rust’s standard library also includes a number of other string types, such as
<code>OsString</code>, <code>OsStr</code>, <code>CString</code>, and <code>CStr</code>. Library crates can provide even
more options for storing string data. Similar to the <code>*String</code>/<code>*Str</code> naming,
they often provide an owned and borrowed variant, just like <code>String</code>/<code>&amp;str</code>.
These string types can store text in different encodings or be represented in
memory in a different way, for example. We won’t discuss these other string
types in this chapter; see their API documentation for more about how to use
them and when each is appropriate.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-a-new-string" id="creating-a-new-string"><h3>Creating a New String</h3></a>
<p>Many of the same operations available with <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> are available with <code>String</code>
as well, starting with the <code>new</code> function to create a string, shown in Listing
8-11:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut s = String::new();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-11: Creating a new, empty <code>String</code></span></p>
<p>This line creates a new empty string called <code>s</code> that we can then load data
into. Often, we’ll have some initial data that we want to start the string
with. For that, we use the <code>to_string</code> method, which is available on any type
that implements the <code>Display</code> trait, which string literals do. Listing 8-12
shows two examples:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let data = &quot;initial contents&quot;;

let s = data.to_string();

// the method also works on a literal directly:
let s = &quot;initial contents&quot;.to_string();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-12: Using the <code>to_string</code> method to create a
<code>String</code> from a string literal</span></p>
<p>This code creates a string containing <code>initial contents</code>.</p>
<p>We can also use the function <code>String::from</code> to create a <code>String</code> from a string
literal. The code in Listing 8-13 is equivalent to the code from Listing 8-12
that uses <code>to_string</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let s = String::from(&quot;initial contents&quot;);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-13: Using the <code>String::from</code> function to create
a <code>String</code> from a string literal</span></p>
<p>Because strings are used for so many things, we can use many different generic
APIs for strings, providing us with a lot of options. Some of them can seem
redundant, but they all have their place! In this case, <code>String::from</code> and
<code>to_string</code> do the same thing, so which you choose is a matter of style.</p>
<p>Remember that strings are UTF-8 encoded, so we can include any properly encoded
data in them, as shown in Listing 8-14:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let hello = String::from(&quot;السلام عليكم&quot;);
let hello = String::from(&quot;Dobrý den&quot;);
let hello = String::from(&quot;Hello&quot;);
let hello = String::from(&quot;שָׁלוֹם&quot;);
let hello = String::from(&quot;नमस्ते&quot;);
let hello = String::from(&quot;こんにちは&quot;);
let hello = String::from(&quot;안녕하세요&quot;);
let hello = String::from(&quot;你好&quot;);
let hello = String::from(&quot;Olá&quot;);
let hello = String::from(&quot;Здравствуйте&quot;);
let hello = String::from(&quot;Hola&quot;);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-14: Storing greetings in different languages in

<p>All of these are valid <code>String</code> values.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#updating-a-string" id="updating-a-string"><h3>Updating a String</h3></a>
<p>A <code>String</code> can grow in size and its contents can change, just like the contents
of a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, by pushing more data into it. In addition, we can conveniently
use the <code>+</code> operator or the <code>format!</code> macro to concatenate <code>String</code> values
together.</p>

<p>We can grow a <code>String</code> by using the <code>push_str</code> method to append a string slice,
as shown in Listing 8-15:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut s = String::from(&quot;foo&quot;);
s.push_str(&quot;bar&quot;);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-15: Appending a string slice to a <code>String</code>
using the <code>push_str</code> method</span></p>
<p>After these two lines, <code>s</code> will contain <code>foobar</code>. The <code>push_str</code> method takes a
string slice because we don’t necessarily want to take ownership of the
parameter. For example, the code in Listing 8-16 shows that it would be
unfortunate if we weren’t able to use <code>s2</code> after appending its contents to <code>s1</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut s1 = String::from(&quot;foo&quot;);
let s2 = &quot;bar&quot;;
s1.push_str(&amp;s2);
println!(&quot;s2 is {}&quot;, s2);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-16: Using a string slice after appending its

<p>If the <code>push_str</code> method took ownership of <code>s2</code>, we wouldn’t be able to print
out its value on the last line. However, this code works as we’d expect!</p>
<p>The <code>push</code> method takes a single character as a parameter and adds it to the
<code>String</code>. Listing 8-17 shows code that adds the letter l character to a
<code>String</code> using the <code>push</code> method:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut s = String::from(&quot;lo&quot;);
s.push('l');
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-17: Adding one character to a <code>String</code> value

<p>As a result of this code, <code>s</code> will contain <code>lol</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#concatenation-with-the--operator-or-the-format-macro" id="concatenation-with-the--operator-or-the-format-macro"><h4>Concatenation with the <code>+</code> Operator or the <code>format!</code> Macro</h4></a>
<p>Often, we’ll want to combine two existing strings. One way is to use the <code>+</code>
operator, as shown in Listing 8-18:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let s1 = String::from(&quot;Hello, &quot;);
let s2 = String::from(&quot;world!&quot;);
let s3 = s1 + &amp;s2; // Note that s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-18: Using the <code>+</code> operator to combine two
<code>String</code> values into a new <code>String</code> value</span></p>
<p>The string <code>s3</code> will contain <code>Hello, world!</code> as a result of this code. The
reason <code>s1</code> is no longer valid after the addition and the reason we used a
reference to <code>s2</code> has to do with the signature of the method that gets called
when we use the <code>+</code> operator. The <code>+</code> operator uses the <code>add</code> method, whose
signature looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn add(self, s: &amp;str) -&gt; String {
</code></pre>
<p>This isn’t the exact signature that’s in the standard library: in the standard
library, <code>add</code> is defined using generics. Here, we’re looking at the signature
of <code>add</code> with concrete types substituted for the generic ones, which is what
happens when we call this method with <code>String</code> values. We’ll discuss generics
in Chapter 10. This signature gives us the clues we need to understand the
tricky bits of the <code>+</code> operator.</p>
<p>First, <code>s2</code> has an <code>&amp;</code>, meaning that we’re adding a <em>reference</em> of the second
string to the first string because of the <code>s</code> parameter in the <code>add</code> function:
we can only add a <code>&amp;str</code> to a <code>String</code>; we can’t add two <code>String</code> values
together. But wait - the type of <code>&amp;s2</code> is <code>&amp;String</code>, not <code>&amp;str</code>, as specified
in the second parameter to <code>add</code>. So why does Listing 8-18 compile?</p>
<p>The reason we’re able to use <code>&amp;s2</code> in the call to <code>add</code> is that the compiler
can <em>coerce</em> the <code>&amp;String</code> argument into a <code>&amp;str</code>. When we call the <code>add</code>
method, Rust uses a <em>deref coercion</em>, which here turns <code>&amp;s2</code> into <code>&amp;s2[..]</code>.
We’ll discuss deref coercion in more depth in Chapter 15. Because <code>add</code> does
not take ownership of the <code>s</code> parameter, <code>s2</code> will still be a valid <code>String</code>
after this operation.</p>
<p>Second, we can see in the signature that <code>add</code> takes ownership of <code>self</code>,
because <code>self</code> does <em>not</em> have an <code>&amp;</code>. This means <code>s1</code> in Listing 8-18 will be
moved into the <code>add</code> call and no longer be valid after that. So although <code>let s3 = s1 + &amp;s2;</code> looks like it will copy both strings and create a new one, this
statement actually takes ownership of <code>s1</code>, appends a copy of the contents of
<code>s2</code>, and then returns ownership of the result. In other words, it looks like
it’s making a lot of copies but isn’t: the implementation is more efficient
than copying.</p>
<p>If we need to concatenate multiple strings, the behavior of <code>+</code> gets unwieldy:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let s1 = String::from(&quot;tic&quot;);
let s2 = String::from(&quot;tac&quot;);
let s3 = String::from(&quot;toe&quot;);

let s = s1 + &quot;-&quot; + &amp;s2 + &quot;-&quot; + &amp;s3;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>At this point, <code>s</code> will be <code>tic-tac-toe</code>. With all of the <code>+</code> and <code>&quot;</code>
characters, it’s difficult to see what’s going on. For more complicated string
combining, we can use the <code>format!</code> macro:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let s1 = String::from(&quot;tic&quot;);
let s2 = String::from(&quot;tac&quot;);
let s3 = String::from(&quot;toe&quot;);

let s = format!(&quot;{}-{}-{}&quot;, s1, s2, s3);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code also sets <code>s</code> to <code>tic-tac-toe</code>. The <code>format!</code> macro works in the same
way as <code>println!</code>, but instead of printing the output to the screen, it returns
a <code>String</code> with the contents. The version of the code using <code>format!</code> is much
easier to read and also doesn’t take ownership of any of its parameters.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#indexing-into-strings" id="indexing-into-strings"><h3>Indexing into Strings</h3></a>
<p>In many other programming languages, accessing individual characters in a
string by referencing them by index is a valid and common operation. However,
if we try to access parts of a <code>String</code> using indexing syntax in Rust, we’ll
get an error. Consider the invalid code in Listing 8-19:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
let h = s1[0];
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-19: Attempting to use indexing syntax with a

<p>The error and the note tell the story: Rust strings don’t support indexing. But
why not? To answer that question, we need to discuss how Rust stores strings in
memory.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#internal-representation" id="internal-representation"><h4>Internal Representation</h4></a>
<p>A <code>String</code> is a wrapper over a <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code>. Let’s look at some of our properly
encoded UTF-8 example strings from Listing 8-14. First, this one:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let len = String::from(&quot;Hola&quot;).len();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>len</code> will be four, which means the <code>Vec</code> storing the string
“Hola” is four bytes long. Each of these letters takes one byte when encoded in
UTF-8. But what about the following line?</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let len = String::from(&quot;Здравствуйте&quot;).len();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that this string begins with the capital Cyrillic letter Ze, not the
Arabic number 3. Asked how long the string is, you might say 12. However,
Rust’s answer is 24: that’s the number of bytes it takes to encode
“Здравствуйте” in UTF-8, because each Unicode scalar value takes two bytes of
storage. Therefore, an index into the string’s bytes will not always correlate
to a valid Unicode scalar value. To demonstrate, consider this invalid Rust
code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let hello = &quot;Здравствуйте&quot;;
let answer = &amp;hello[0];
</code></pre>
<p>What should the value of <code>answer</code> be? Should it be <code>З</code>, the first letter? When
encoded in UTF-8, the first byte of <code>З</code> is <code>208</code>, and the second is <code>151</code>, so
<code>answer</code> should in fact be <code>208</code>, but <code>208</code> is not a valid character on its
own. Returning <code>208</code> is likely not what a user would want if they asked for the
first letter of this string; however, that’s the only data that Rust has at
byte index 0. Returning the byte value is probably not what users want, even if
the string contains only Latin letters: if <code>&amp;&quot;hello&quot;[0]</code> was valid code that
returned the byte value, it would return <code>104</code>, not <code>h</code>. To avoid returning an
unexpected value and causing bugs that might not be discovered immediately,
Rust doesn’t compile this code at all and prevents misunderstandings earlier in
the development process.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#bytes-and-scalar-values-and-grapheme-clusters-oh-my" id="bytes-and-scalar-values-and-grapheme-clusters-oh-my"><h4>Bytes and Scalar Values and Grapheme Clusters! Oh My!</h4></a>
<p>Another point about UTF-8 is that there are actually three relevant ways to
look at strings from Rust’s perspective: as bytes, scalar values, and grapheme
clusters (the closest thing to what we would call <em>letters</em>).</p>
<p>If we look at the Hindi word “नमस्ते” written in the Devanagari script, it is
ultimately stored as a <code>Vec</code> of <code>u8</code> values that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164,
224, 165, 135]
</code></pre>
<p>That’s 18 bytes and is how computers ultimately store this data. If we look at
them as Unicode scalar values, which are what Rust’s <code>char</code> type is, those
bytes look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">['न', 'म', 'स', '्', 'त', 'े']
</code></pre>
<p>There are six <code>char</code> values here, but the fourth and sixth are not letters:
they’re diacritics that don’t make sense on their own. Finally, if we look at
them as grapheme clusters, we’d get what a person would call the four letters
that make up the Hindi word:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[&quot;न&quot;, &quot;म&quot;, &quot;स्&quot;, &quot;ते&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Rust provides different ways of interpreting the raw string data that computers
store so that each program can choose the interpretation it needs, no matter
what human language the data is in.</p>
<p>A final reason Rust doesn’t allow us to index into a <code>String</code> to get a
character is that indexing operations are expected to always take constant time
(O(1)). But it isn’t possible to guarantee that performance with a <code>String</code>,
because Rust would have to walk through the contents from the beginning to the
index to determine how many valid characters there were.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#slicing-strings" id="slicing-strings"><h3>Slicing Strings</h3></a>
<p>Indexing into a string is often a bad idea because it’s not clear what the
return type of the string indexing operation should be: a byte value, a
character, a grapheme cluster, or a string slice. Therefore, Rust asks you to
be more specific if you really need to use indices to create string slices. To
be more specific in your indexing and indicate that you want a string slice,
rather than indexing using <code>[]</code> with a single number, you can use <code>[]</code> with a
range to create a string slice containing particular bytes:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let hello = &quot;Здравствуйте&quot;;

let s = &amp;hello[0..4];
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, <code>s</code> will be a <code>&amp;str</code> that contains the first four bytes of the string.
Earlier, we mentioned that each of these characters was two bytes, which means
<code>s</code> will be <code>Зд</code>.</p>
<p>What would happen if we used <code>&amp;hello[0..1]</code>? The answer: Rust will panic at
runtime in the same way that accessing an invalid index in a vector does:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'main' panicked at 'byte index 1 is not a char boundary; it is inside 'З' (bytes 0..2) of `Здравствуйте`', src/libcore/str/mod.rs:2188:4
</code></pre>
<p>You should use ranges to create string slices with caution, because it can
crash your program.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#methods-for-iterating-over-strings" id="methods-for-iterating-over-strings"><h3>Methods for Iterating Over Strings</h3></a>
<p>Fortunately, we can access elements in a string in other ways.</p>
<p>If we need to perform operations on individual Unicode scalar values, the best
way to do so is to use the <code>chars</code> method. Calling <code>chars</code> on “नमस्ते” separates
out and returns six values of type <code>char</code>, and we can iterate over the result
in order to access each element:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
for c in &quot;नमस्ते&quot;.chars() {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, c);
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code will print the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">न
म
स
्
त
े
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>bytes</code> method returns each raw byte, which might be appropriate for your
domain:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
for b in &quot;नमस्ते&quot;.bytes() {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, b);
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code will print the 18 bytes that make up this <code>String</code>, starting with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">224
164
168
224
// ... etc
</code></pre>
<p>But be sure to remember that valid Unicode scalar values may be made up of more
than one byte.</p>
<p>Getting grapheme clusters from strings is complex, so this functionality is not
provided by the standard library. Crates are available on
<a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> if this is the functionality you need.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#strings-are-not-so-simple" id="strings-are-not-so-simple"><h3>Strings Are Not So Simple</h3></a>
<p>To summarize, strings are complicated. Different programming languages make
different choices about how to present this complexity to the programmer. Rust
has chosen to make the correct handling of <code>String</code> data the default behavior
for all Rust programs, which means programmers have to put more thought into
handling UTF-8 data upfront. This trade-off exposes more of the complexity of
strings than other programming languages do but prevents you from having to
handle errors involving non-ASCII characters later in your development life
cycle.</p>
<p>Let’s switch to something a bit less complex: hash maps!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#hash-maps-store-keys-associated-with-values" id="hash-maps-store-keys-associated-with-values"><h2>Hash Maps Store Keys Associated with Values</h2></a>
<p>The last of our common collections is the <em>hash map</em>. The type <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code>
stores a mapping of keys of type <code>K</code> to values of type <code>V</code>. It does this via a
<em>hashing function</em>, which determines how it places these keys and values into
memory. Many different programming languages support this kind of data
structure, but often use a different name, such as hash, map, object, hash
table, or associative array, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Hash maps are useful for when you want to look up data not by an index, as you
can with vectors, but by using a key that can be of any type. For example, in a
game, you could keep track of each team’s score in a hash map where each key is
a team’s name and the values are each team’s score. Given a team name, you can
retrieve its score.</p>
<p>We’ll go over the basic API of hash maps in this section, but many more goodies
are hiding in the functions defined on <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> by the standard library.
As always, check the standard library documentation for more information.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-a-new-hash-map" id="creating-a-new-hash-map"><h3>Creating a New Hash Map</h3></a>
<p>We can create an empty hash map with <code>new</code> and add elements with <code>insert</code>. In
Listing 8-20, we’re keeping track of the scores of two teams whose names are
Blue and Yellow. The Blue team will start with 10 points, and the Yellow team
starts with 50:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from(&quot;Blue&quot;), 10);
scores.insert(String::from(&quot;Yellow&quot;), 50);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-20: Creating a new hash map and inserting some
keys and values</span></p>
<p>Note that we need to first <code>use</code> the <code>HashMap</code> from the collections portion of
the standard library. Of our three common collections, this one is the least
often used, so it’s not included in the features brought into scope
automatically in the prelude. Hash maps also have less support from the
standard library; there’s no built-in macro to construct them, for example.</p>
<p>Just like vectors, hash maps store their data on the heap. This <code>HashMap</code> has
keys of type <code>String</code> and values of type <code>i32</code>. Like vectors, hash maps are
homogeneous: all of the keys must have the same type, and all of the values
must have the same type.</p>
<p>Another way of constructing a hash map is by using the <code>collect</code> method on a
vector of tuples, where each tuple consists of a key and its value. The
<code>collect</code> method gathers data into a number of collection types, including
<code>HashMap</code>. For example, if we had the team names and initial scores in two
separate vectors, we can use the <code>zip</code> method to create a vector of tuples
where “Blue” is paired with 10, and so forth. Then we can use the <code>collect</code>
method to turn that vector of tuples into a <code>HashMap</code> as shown in Listing 8-21:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::collections::HashMap;

let teams  = vec![String::from(&quot;Blue&quot;), String::from(&quot;Yellow&quot;)];
let initial_scores = vec![10, 50];

let scores: HashMap&lt;_, _&gt; = teams.iter().zip(initial_scores.iter()).collect();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-21: Creating a hash map from a list of teams
and a list of scores</span></p>
<p>The type annotation <code>HashMap&lt;_, _&gt;</code> is needed here because it’s possible to
<code>collect</code> into many different data structures, and Rust doesn’t know which you
want unless you specify. For the type parameters for the key and value types,
however, we use underscores, and Rust can infer the types that the hash map
contains based on the types of the data in the vectors.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#hash-maps-and-ownership" id="hash-maps-and-ownership"><h3>Hash Maps and Ownership</h3></a>
<p>For types that implement the <code>Copy</code> trait, like <code>i32</code>, the values are copied
into the hash map. For owned values like <code>String</code>, the values will be moved and
the hash map will be the owner of those values as demonstrated in Listing 8-22:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::collections::HashMap;

let field_name = String::from(&quot;Favorite color&quot;);
let field_value = String::from(&quot;Blue&quot;);

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert(field_name, field_value);
// field_name and field_value are invalid at this point, try using them and
// see what compiler error you get!
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-22: Showing that keys and values are owned by
the hash map once they’re inserted</span></p>
<p>We aren’t able to use the variables <code>field_name</code> and <code>field_value</code> after
they’ve been moved into the hash map with the call to <code>insert</code>.</p>
<p>If we insert references to values into the hash map, the values won’t be moved
into the hash map. The values that the references point to must be valid for at
least as long as the hash map is valid. We’ll talk more about these issues in
the “Validating References with Lifetimes” section in Chapter 10.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#accessing-values-in-a-hash-map" id="accessing-values-in-a-hash-map"><h3>Accessing Values in a Hash Map</h3></a>
<p>We can get a value out of the hash map by providing its key to the <code>get</code> method
as shown in Listing 8-23:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from(&quot;Blue&quot;), 10);
scores.insert(String::from(&quot;Yellow&quot;), 50);

let team_name = String::from(&quot;Blue&quot;);
let score = scores.get(&amp;team_name);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-23: Accessing the score for the Blue team
stored in the hash map</span></p>
<p>Here, <code>score</code> will have the value that’s associated with the Blue team, and the
result will be <code>Some(&amp;10)</code>. The result is wrapped in <code>Some</code> because <code>get</code>
returns an <code>Option&lt;&amp;V&gt;</code>; if there’s no value for that key in the hash map,
<code>get</code> will return <code>None</code>. The program will need to handle the <code>Option</code> in one
of the ways that we covered in Chapter 6.</p>
<p>We can iterate over each key/value pair in a hash map in a similar manner as we
do with vectors, using a <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from(&quot;Blue&quot;), 10);
scores.insert(String::from(&quot;Yellow&quot;), 50);

for (key, value) in &amp;scores {
    println!(&quot;{}: {}&quot;, key, value);
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code will print each pair in an arbitrary order:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Yellow: 50
Blue: 10
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#updating-a-hash-map" id="updating-a-hash-map"><h3>Updating a Hash Map</h3></a>
<p>Although the number of keys and values is growable, each key can only have one
value associated with it at a time. When we want to change the data in a hash
map, we have to decide how to handle the case when a key already has a value
assigned. We could replace the old value with the new value, completely
disregarding the old value. We could keep the old value and ignore the new
value, and only add the new value if the key <em>doesn’t</em> already have a value. Or
we could combine the old value and the new value. Let’s look at how to do each
of these!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#overwriting-a-value" id="overwriting-a-value"><h4>Overwriting a Value</h4></a>
<p>If we insert a key and a value into a hash map, and then insert that same key
with a different value, the value associated with that key will be replaced.
Even though the code in Listing 8-24 calls <code>insert</code> twice, the hash map will
only contain one key/value pair because we’re inserting the value for the Blue
team’s key both times:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from(&quot;Blue&quot;), 10);
scores.insert(String::from(&quot;Blue&quot;), 25);

println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, scores);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-24: Replacing a value stored with a particular
key</span></p>
<p>This code will print <code>{&quot;Blue&quot;: 25}</code>. The original value of <code>10</code> has been
overwritten.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#only-insert-if-the-key-has-no-value" id="only-insert-if-the-key-has-no-value"><h4>Only Insert If the Key Has No Value</h4></a>
<p>It’s common to check whether a particular key has a value, and if it doesn’t,
insert a value for it. Hash maps have a special API for this called <code>entry</code>
that takes the key we want to check as a parameter. The return value of the
<code>entry</code> function is an enum called <code>Entry</code> that represents a value that might
or might not exist. Let’s say we want to check whether the key for the Yellow
team has a value associated with it. If it doesn’t, we want to insert the value
50, and the same for the Blue team. Using the <code>entry</code> API, the code looks like
Listing 8-25:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();
scores.insert(String::from(&quot;Blue&quot;), 10);

scores.entry(String::from(&quot;Yellow&quot;)).or_insert(50);
scores.entry(String::from(&quot;Blue&quot;)).or_insert(50);

println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, scores);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-25: Using the <code>entry</code> method to only insert if
the key does not already have a value</span></p>
<p>The <code>or_insert</code> method on <code>Entry</code> is defined to return the value for the
corresponding <code>Entry</code> key if that key exists, and if not, inserts the parameter
as the new value for this key and returns the modified <code>Entry</code>. This technique
is much cleaner than writing the logic ourselves, and in addition, plays more
nicely with the borrow checker.</p>
<p>Running the code in Listing 8-25 will print <code>{&quot;Yellow&quot;: 50, &quot;Blue&quot;: 10}</code>. The
first call to <code>entry</code> will insert the key for the Yellow team with the value
<code>50</code> because the Yellow team doesn’t have a value already. The second call to
<code>entry</code> will not change the hash map because the Blue team already has the
value <code>10</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#updating-a-value-based-on-the-old-value" id="updating-a-value-based-on-the-old-value"><h4>Updating a Value Based on the Old Value</h4></a>
<p>Another common use case for hash maps is to look up a key’s value and then
update it based on the old value. For instance, Listing 8-26 shows code that
counts how many times each word appears in some text. We use a hash map with
the words as keys and increment the value to keep track of how many times we’ve
seen that word. If it’s the first time we’ve seen a word, we’ll first insert
the value <code>0</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::collections::HashMap;

let text = &quot;hello world wonderful world&quot;;

let mut map = HashMap::new();

for word in text.split_whitespace() {
    let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);
    *count += 1;
}

println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, map);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-26: Counting occurrences of words using a hash
map that stores words and counts</span></p>
<p>This code will print <code>{&quot;world&quot;: 2, &quot;hello&quot;: 1, &quot;wonderful&quot;: 1}</code>. The
<code>or_insert</code> method actually returns a mutable reference (<code>&amp;mut V</code>) to the value
for this key. Here we store that mutable reference in the <code>count</code> variable, so
in order to assign to that value we must first dereference <code>count</code> using the
asterisk (<code>*</code>). The mutable reference goes out of scope at the end of the <code>for</code>
loop, so all of these changes are safe and allowed by the borrowing rules.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#hashing-function" id="hashing-function"><h3>Hashing Function</h3></a>
<p>By default, <code>HashMap</code> uses a cryptographically secure hashing function that can
provide resistance to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This is not the fastest
hashing algorithm available, but the trade-off for better security that comes
with the drop in performance is worth it. If you profile your code and find
that the default hash function is too slow for your purposes, you can switch to
another function by specifying a different <em>hasher</em>. A hasher is a type that
implements the <code>BuildHasher</code> trait. We’ll talk about traits and how to
implement them in Chapter 10. You don’t necessarily have to implement your own
hasher from scratch; <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> has libraries shared by
other Rust users that provide hashers implementing many common hashing
algorithms.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#summary-6" id="summary-6"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>Vectors, strings, and hash maps will provide a large amount of functionality
that you need in programs where you need to store, access, and modify data.
Here are some exercises you should now be equipped to solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a list of integers, use a vector and return the mean (average), median
(when sorted, the value in the middle position), and mode (the value that
occurs most often; a hash map will be helpful here) of the list.</li>
<li>Convert strings to pig latin. The first consonant of each word is moved to
the end of the word and “ay” is added, so “first” becomes “irst-fay.” Words
that start with a vowel have “hay” added to the end instead (“apple” becomes
“apple-hay”). Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 encoding!</li>
<li>Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add
employee names to a department in a company. For example, “Add Sally to
Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then let the user retrieve a list of all
people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted
alphabetically.</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard library API documentation describes methods that vectors, strings,
and hash maps have that will be helpful for these exercises!</p>
<p>We’re getting into more complex programs in which operations can fail; so, it’s
a perfect time to discuss error handling next!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#error-handling" id="error-handling"><h1>Error Handling</h1></a>
<p>Rust’s commitment to reliability extends to error handling. Errors are a fact
of life in software, so Rust has a number of features for handling situations
in which something goes wrong. In many cases, Rust requires you to acknowledge
the possibility of an error occurring and take some action before your code
will compile. This requirement makes your program more robust by ensuring that
you’ll discover errors and handle them appropriately before you’ve deployed
your code to production!</p>
<p>Rust groups errors into two major categories: <em>recoverable</em> and <em>unrecoverable</em>
errors. Recoverable errors are situations in which it’s reasonable to report
the problem to the user and retry the operation, like a file not found error.
Unrecoverable errors are always symptoms of bugs, like trying to access a
location beyond the end of an array.</p>
<p>Most languages don’t distinguish between these two kinds of errors and handle
both in the same way using mechanisms like exceptions. Rust doesn’t have
exceptions. Instead, it has the type <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> for recoverable errors and
the <code>panic!</code> macro that stops execution when it encounters unrecoverable
errors. This chapter covers calling <code>panic!</code> first and then talks about
returning <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> values. Additionally, we’ll explore considerations to
take into account when deciding whether to try to recover from an error or to
stop execution.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#unrecoverable-errors-with-panic" id="unrecoverable-errors-with-panic"><h2>Unrecoverable Errors with <code>panic!</code></h2></a>
<p>Sometimes, bad things happen in your code, and there’s nothing you can do about
it. In these cases, Rust has the <code>panic!</code> macro. When the <code>panic!</code> macro
executes, your program will print a failure message, unwind and clean up the
stack, and then quit. The most common situation this occurs in is when a bug of
some kind has been detected, and it’s not clear to the programmer how to handle
the error.</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#unwinding-the-stack-or-aborting-in-response-to-a-panic" id="unwinding-the-stack-or-aborting-in-response-to-a-panic"><h3>Unwinding the Stack or Aborting in Response to a <code>panic!</code></h3></a>
<p>By default, when a <code>panic!</code> occurs, the program starts <em>unwinding</em>, which
means Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each function
it encounters. But this walking back and cleanup is a lot of work. The
alternative is to immediately <em>abort</em>, which ends the program without
cleaning up. Memory that the program was using will then need to be cleaned
up by the operating system. If in your project you need to make the resulting
binary as small as possible, you can switch from unwinding to aborting on
panic by adding <code>panic = 'abort'</code> to the appropriate <code>[profile]</code> sections in
your <em>Cargo.toml</em> file. For example, if you want to abort on panic in release
mode, add this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[profile.release]
panic = 'abort'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s try calling <code>panic!</code> in a simple program:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust should_panic">fn main() {
    panic!(&quot;crash and burn&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>When you run the program, you’ll see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling panic v0.1.0 (file:///projects/panic)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.25 secs
     Running `target/debug/panic`
thread 'main' panicked at 'crash and burn', src/main.rs:2:4
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
</code></pre>
<p>The call to <code>panic!</code> causes the error message contained in the last three
lines. The first line shows our panic message and the place in our source code
where the panic occurred: <em>src/main.rs:2:4</em> indicates that it’s the second
line, fourth character of our <em>src/main.rs</em> file.</p>
<p>In this case, the line indicated is part of our code, and if we go to that
line, we see the <code>panic!</code> macro call. In other cases, the <code>panic!</code> call might
be in code that our code calls. The filename and line number reported by the
error message will be someone else’s code where the <code>panic!</code> macro is called,
not the line of our code that eventually led to the <code>panic!</code> call. We can use
the backtrace of the functions the <code>panic!</code> call came from to figure out the
part of our code that is causing the problem. We’ll discuss what a backtrace is
in more detail next.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-a-panic-backtrace" id="using-a-panic-backtrace"><h3>Using a <code>panic!</code> Backtrace</h3></a>
<p>Let’s look at another example to see what it’s like when a <code>panic!</code> call comes
from a library because of a bug in our code instead of from our code calling
the macro directly. Listing 9-1 has some code that attempts to access an
element by index in a vector:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust should_panic">fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    v[99];
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-1: Attempting to access an element beyond the
end of a vector, which will cause a <code>panic!</code></span></p>
<p>Here, we’re attempting to access the hundredth element of our vector (which is
at index 99 because indexing starts at zero), but it has only three elements.
In this situation, Rust will panic. Using <code>[]</code> is supposed to return an
element, but if you pass an invalid index, there’s no element that Rust could
return here that would be correct.</p>
<p>Other languages, like C, will attempt to give you exactly what you asked for in
this situation, even though it isn’t what you want: you’ll get whatever is at
the location in memory that would correspond to that element in the vector,
even though the memory doesn’t belong to the vector. This is called a <em>buffer
overread</em> and can lead to security vulnerabilities if an attacker is able to
manipulate the index in such a way as to read data they shouldn’t be allowed to
that is stored after the array.</p>
<p>To protect your program from this sort of vulnerability, if you try to read an
element at an index that doesn’t exist, Rust will stop execution and refuse to
continue. Let’s try it and see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run

note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
error: Process didn't exit successfully: `target/debug/panic` (exit code: 101)
</code></pre>
<p>This error points at a file we didn’t write, <em>vec.rs</em>. That’s the
implementation of <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> in the standard library. The code that gets run when
we use <code>[]</code> on our vector <code>v</code> is in <em>vec.rs</em>, and that is where the <code>panic!</code> is
actually happening.</p>
<p>The next note line tells us that we can set the <code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code> environment
variable to get a backtrace of exactly what happened to cause the error. A
<em>backtrace</em> is a list of all the functions that have been called to get to this
point. Backtraces in Rust work like they do in other languages: the key to
reading the backtrace is to start from the top and read until you see files you
wrote. That’s the spot where the problem originated. The lines above the lines
mentioning your files are code that your code called; the lines below are code
that called your code. These lines might include core Rust code, standard
library code, or crates that you’re using. Let’s try getting a backtrace:
Listing 9-2 shows output similar to what you’ll see:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-2: The backtrace generated by a call to
<code>panic!</code> displayed when the environment variable <code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code> is set</span></p>
<p>That’s a lot of output! The exact output you see might be different depending
on your operating system and Rust version. In order to get backtraces with this
information, debug symbols must be enabled. Debug symbols are enabled by
default when using cargo build or cargo run without the --release flag, as we
have here.</p>
<p>In the output in Listing 9-2, line 11 of the backtrace points to the line in
our project that’s causing the problem: <em>src/main.rs</em> in line 4. If we don’t
want our program to panic, the location pointed to by the first line mentioning
a file we wrote is where we should start investigating to figure out how we got
to this location with values that caused the panic. In Listing 9-1 where we
deliberately wrote code that would panic in order to demonstrate how to use
backtraces, the way to fix the panic is to not request an element at index 99
from a vector that only contains three items. When your code panics in the
future, you’ll need to figure out what action the code is taking with what
values that causes the panic and what the code should do instead.</p>
<p>We’ll come back to <code>panic!</code> and when we should and should not use <code>panic!</code> to
handle error conditions later in the chapter. Next, we’ll look at how to
recover from an error using <code>Result</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#recoverable-errors-with-result" id="recoverable-errors-with-result"><h2>Recoverable Errors with <code>Result</code></h2></a>
<p>Most errors aren’t serious enough to require the program to stop entirely.
Sometimes, when a function fails, it’s for a reason that we can easily
interpret and respond to. For example, if we try to open a file and that
operation fails because the file doesn’t exist, we might want to create the
file instead of terminating the process.</p>
<p>Recall from “<a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#handling-potential-failure-with-the-result-type">Handling Potential Failure with the <code>Result</code>
Type</a><!-- ignore -->” in Chapter 2 that the <code>Result</code> enum is
defined as having two variants, <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>, as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum Result&lt;T, E&gt; {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>T</code> and <code>E</code> are generic type parameters: we’ll discuss generics in more
detail in Chapter 10. What you need to know right now is that <code>T</code> represents
the type of the value that will be returned in a success case within the <code>Ok</code>
variant, and <code>E</code> represents the type of the error that will be returned in a
failure case within the <code>Err</code> variant. Because <code>Result</code> has these generic type
parameters, we can use the <code>Result</code> type and the functions that the standard
library has defined on it in many different situations where the successful
value and error value we want to return may differ.</p>
<p>Let’s call a function that returns a <code>Result</code> value because the function could
fail: in Listing 9-3 we try to open a file:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-3: Opening a file</span></p>
<p>How do we know <code>File::open</code> returns a <code>Result</code>? We could look at the standard
library API documentation, or we could ask the compiler! If we give <code>f</code> a type
annotation of a type that we know the return type of the function is <em>not</em> and
then we try to compile the code, the compiler will tell us that the types don’t
match. The error message will then tell us what the type of <code>f</code> <em>is</em>. Let’s try
it: we know that the return type of <code>File::open</code> isn’t of type <code>u32</code>, so let’s
change the <code>let f</code> statement to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let f: u32 = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Attempting to compile now gives us the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --&gt; src/main.rs:4:18
  |
4 |     let f: u32 = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;);
  |                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected u32, found enum
`std::result::Result`
  |
  = note: expected type `u32`
             found type `std::result::Result&lt;std::fs::File, std::io::Error&gt;`
</code></pre>
<p>This tells us the return type of the <code>File::open</code> function is a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>.
The generic parameter <code>T</code> has been filled in here with the type of the success
value, <code>std::fs::File</code>, which is a file handle. The type of <code>E</code> used in the
error value is <code>std::io::Error</code>.</p>
<p>This return type means the call to <code>File::open</code> might succeed and return to us
a file handle that we can read from or write to. The function call also might
fail: for example, the file might not exist or we might not have permission to
access the file. The <code>File::open</code> function needs to have a way to tell us
whether it succeeded or failed and at the same time give us either the file
handle or error information. This information is exactly what the <code>Result</code> enum
conveys.</p>
<p>In the case where <code>File::open</code> succeeds, the value we will have in the variable
<code>f</code> will be an instance of <code>Ok</code> that contains a file handle. In the case where
it fails, the value in <code>f</code> will be an instance of <code>Err</code> that contains more
information about the kind of error that happened.</p>
<p>We need to add to the code in Listing 9-3 to take different actions depending
on the value <code>File::open</code> returned. Listing 9-4 shows one way to handle the
<code>Result</code> using a basic tool: the <code>match</code> expression that we discussed in
Chapter 6.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust should_panic">use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;);

    let f = match f {
        Ok(file) =&gt; file,
        Err(error) =&gt; {
            panic!(&quot;There was a problem opening the file: {:?}&quot;, error)
        },
    };
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-4: Using a <code>match</code> expression to handle the
<code>Result</code> variants we might have</span></p>
<p>Note that, like the <code>Option</code> enum, the <code>Result</code> enum and its variants have been
imported in the prelude, so we don’t need to specify <code>Result::</code> before the <code>Ok</code>
and <code>Err</code> variants in the <code>match</code> arms.</p>
<p>Here we tell Rust that when the result is <code>Ok</code>, return the inner <code>file</code> value
out of the <code>Ok</code> variant, and we then assign that file handle value to the
variable <code>f</code>. After the <code>match</code>, we can then use the file handle for reading or
writing.</p>
<p>The other arm of the <code>match</code> handles the case where we get an <code>Err</code> value from
<code>File::open</code>. In this example, we’ve chosen to call the <code>panic!</code> macro. If
there’s no file named <em>hello.txt</em> in our current directory and we run this
code, we’ll see the following output from the <code>panic!</code> macro:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'main' panicked at 'There was a problem opening the file: Error { repr:
Os { code: 2, message: &quot;No such file or directory&quot; } }', src/main.rs:9:12
</code></pre>
<p>As usual, this output tells us exactly what has gone wrong.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#matching-on-different-errors" id="matching-on-different-errors"><h3>Matching on Different Errors</h3></a>
<p>The code in Listing 9-4 will <code>panic!</code> no matter the reason that <code>File::open</code>
failed. What we want to do instead is take different actions for different
failure reasons: if <code>File::open</code> failed because the file doesn’t exist, we want
to create the file and return the handle to the new file. If <code>File::open</code>
failed for any other reason, for example because we didn’t have permission to
open the file, we still want the code to <code>panic!</code> in the same way as it did in
Listing 9-4. Look at Listing 9-5, which adds another arm to the <code>match</code>:</p>

}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-5: Handling different kinds of errors in
different ways</span></p>
<p>The type of the value that <code>File::open</code> returns inside the <code>Err</code> variant is
<code>io::Error</code>, which is a struct provided by the standard library. This struct
has a method <code>kind</code> that we can call to get an <code>io::ErrorKind</code> value.
<code>io::ErrorKind</code> is an enum provided by the standard library that has variants
representing the different kinds of errors that might result from an <code>io</code>
operation. The variant we want to use is <code>ErrorKind::NotFound</code>, which indicates
the file we’re trying to open doesn’t exist yet.</p>
<p>The condition <code>if error.kind() == ErrorKind::NotFound</code> is called a <em>match
guard</em>: it’s an extra condition on a <code>match</code> arm that further refines the arm’s
pattern. This condition must be true for that arm’s code to be run; otherwise,
the pattern matching will move on to consider the next arm in the <code>match</code>. The
<code>ref</code> in the pattern is needed so <code>error</code> is not moved into the guard condition
but is merely referenced by it. The reason <code>ref</code> is used to take a reference in
a pattern instead of <code>&amp;</code> will be covered in detail in Chapter 18. In short, in
the context of a pattern, <code>&amp;</code> matches a reference and gives us its value, but
<code>ref</code> matches a value and gives us a reference to it.</p>
<p>The condition we want to check in the match guard is whether the value returned
by <code>error.kind()</code> is the <code>NotFound</code> variant of the <code>ErrorKind</code> enum. If it is,
we try to create the file with <code>File::create</code>. However, because <code>File::create</code>
could also fail, we need to add an inner <code>match</code> statement as well. When the
file can’t be opened, a different error message will be printed. The last arm
of the outer <code>match</code> stays the same so the program panics on any error besides
the missing file error.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#shortcuts-for-panic-on-error-unwrap-and-expect" id="shortcuts-for-panic-on-error-unwrap-and-expect"><h3>Shortcuts for Panic on Error: <code>unwrap</code> and <code>expect</code></h3></a>
<p>Using <code>match</code> works well enough, but it can be a bit verbose and doesn’t always
communicate intent well. The <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> type has many helper methods
defined on it to do various tasks. One of those methods, called <code>unwrap</code>, is a
shortcut method that is implemented just like the <code>match</code> statement we wrote in
Listing 9-4. If the <code>Result</code> value is the <code>Ok</code> variant, <code>unwrap</code> will return
the value inside the <code>Ok</code>. If the <code>Result</code> is the <code>Err</code> variant, <code>unwrap</code> will
call the <code>panic!</code> macro for us. Here is an example of <code>unwrap</code> in action:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust should_panic">use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;).unwrap();
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>If we run this code without a <em>hello.txt</em> file, we’ll see an error message from
the <code>panic!</code> call that the <code>unwrap</code> method makes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error {
repr: Os { code: 2, message: &quot;No such file or directory&quot; } }',
src/libcore/result.rs:906:4
</code></pre>
<p>Another method, <code>expect</code>, which is similar to <code>unwrap</code>, lets us also choose the
<code>panic!</code> error message. Using <code>expect</code> instead of <code>unwrap</code> and providing good
error messages can convey your intent and make tracking down the source of a
panic easier. The syntax of <code>expect</code> looks like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust should_panic">use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;).expect(&quot;Failed to open hello.txt&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>We use <code>expect</code> in the same way as <code>unwrap</code>: to return the file handle or call
the <code>panic!</code> macro. The error message used by <code>expect</code> in its call to <code>panic!</code>
will be the parameter that we pass to <code>expect</code>, rather than the default
<code>panic!</code> message that <code>unwrap</code> uses. Here’s what it looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'main' panicked at 'Failed to open hello.txt: Error { repr: Os { code:
2, message: &quot;No such file or directory&quot; } }', src/libcore/result.rs:906:4
</code></pre>
<p>Because this error message starts with the text we specified, <code>Failed to open hello.txt</code>, it will be easier to find where in the code this error message is
coming from. If we use <code>unwrap</code> in multiple places, it can take more time to
figure out exactly which <code>unwrap</code> is causing the panic because all <code>unwrap</code>
calls that panic print the same message.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#propagating-errors" id="propagating-errors"><h3>Propagating Errors</h3></a>
<p>When you’re writing a function whose implementation calls something that might
fail, instead of handling the error within this function, you can return the
error to the calling code so that it can decide what to do. This is known as
<em>propagating</em> the error and gives more control to the calling code where there
might be more information or logic that dictates how the error should be
handled than what you have available in the context of your code.</p>
<p>For example, Listing 9-6 shows a function that reads a username from a file. If
the file doesn’t exist or can’t be read, this function will return those errors
to the code that called this function:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::io;
use std::io::Read;
use std::fs::File;

fn read_username_from_file() -&gt; Result&lt;String, io::Error&gt; {
    let f = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;);

    let mut f = match f {
        Ok(file) =&gt; file,
        Err(e) =&gt; return Err(e),
    };

    let mut s = String::new();

    match f.read_to_string(&amp;mut s) {
        Ok(_) =&gt; Ok(s),
        Err(e) =&gt; Err(e),
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-6: A function that returns errors to the
calling code using <code>match</code></span></p>
<p>Let’s look at the return type of the function first: <code>Result&lt;String, io::Error&gt;</code>. This means the function is returning a value of the type
<code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> where the generic parameter <code>T</code> has been filled in with the
concrete type <code>String</code>, and the generic type <code>E</code> has been filled in with the
concrete type <code>io::Error</code>. If this function succeeds without any problems, the
code that calls this function will receive an <code>Ok</code> value that holds a
<code>String</code>—the username that this function read from the file. If this function
encounters any problems, the code that calls this function will receive an
<code>Err</code> value that holds an instance of <code>io::Error</code> that contains more
information about what the problems were. We chose <code>io::Error</code> as the return
type of this function because that happens to be the type of the error value
returned from both of the operations we’re calling in this function’s body that
might fail: the <code>File::open</code> function and the <code>read_to_string</code> method.</p>
<p>The body of the function starts by calling the <code>File::open</code> function. Then we
handle the <code>Result</code> value returned with a <code>match</code> similar to the <code>match</code> in
Listing 9-4, only instead of calling <code>panic!</code> in the <code>Err</code> case, we return
early from this function and pass the error value from <code>File::open</code> back to the
calling code as this function’s error value. If <code>File::open</code> succeeds, we store
the file handle in the variable <code>f</code> and continue.</p>
<p>Then we create a new <code>String</code> in variable <code>s</code> and call the <code>read_to_string</code>
method on the file handle in <code>f</code> to read the contents of the file into <code>s</code>. The
<code>read_to_string</code> method also returns a <code>Result</code> because it might fail, even
though <code>File::open</code> succeeded. So we need another <code>match</code> to handle that
<code>Result</code>: if <code>read_to_string</code> succeeds, then our function has succeeded, and we
return the username from the file that’s now in <code>s</code> wrapped in an <code>Ok</code>. If
<code>read_to_string</code> fails, we return the error value in the same way that we
returned the error value in the <code>match</code> that handled the return value of
<code>File::open</code>. However, we don’t need to explicitly say <code>return</code>, because this
is the last expression in the function.</p>
<p>The code that calls this code will then handle getting either an <code>Ok</code> value
that contains a username or an <code>Err</code> value that contains an <code>io::Error</code>. We
don’t know what the calling code will do with those values. If the calling code
gets an <code>Err</code> value, it could call <code>panic!</code> and crash the program, use a
default username, or look up the username from somewhere other than a file, for
example. We don’t have enough information on what the calling code is actually
trying to do, so we propagate all the success or error information upwards for
it to handle appropriately.</p>
<p>This pattern of propagating errors is so common in Rust that Rust provides the
question mark operator <code>?</code> to make this easier.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-" id="a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-"><h4>A Shortcut for Propagating Errors: <code>?</code></h4></a>
<p>Listing 9-7 shows an implementation of <code>read_username_from_file</code> that has the
same functionality as it had in Listing 9-6, but this implementation uses the
question mark operator:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::io;
use std::io::Read;
use std::fs::File;

fn read_username_from_file() -&gt; Result&lt;String, io::Error&gt; {
    let mut f = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;)?;
    let mut s = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&amp;mut s)?;
    Ok(s)
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-7: A function that returns errors to the
calling code using <code>?</code></span></p>
<p>The <code>?</code> placed after a <code>Result</code> value is defined to work in almost the same way
as the <code>match</code> expressions we defined to handle the <code>Result</code> values in Listing
9-6. If the value of the <code>Result</code> is an <code>Ok</code>, the value inside the <code>Ok</code> will
get returned from this expression and the program will continue. If the value
is an <code>Err</code>, the value inside the <code>Err</code> will be returned from the whole
function as if we had used the <code>return</code> keyword so the error value gets
propagated to the calling code.</p>
<p>There is a difference between what the <code>match</code> expression from Listing 9-6 and
the question mark operator do: error values used with <code>?</code> go through the <code>from</code>
function, defined in the <code>From</code> trait in the standard library, which is used to
convert errors from one type into another. When the question mark calls the
<code>from</code> function, the error type received is converted into the error type
defined in the return type of the current function. This is useful when a
function returns one error type to represent all the ways a function might
fail, even if parts might fail for many different reasons. As long as each
error type implements the <code>from</code> function to define how to convert itself to
the returned error type, the question mark operator takes care of the
conversion automatically.</p>
<p>In the context of Listing 9-7, the <code>?</code> at the end of the <code>File::open</code> call will
return the value inside an <code>Ok</code> to the variable <code>f</code>. If an error occurs, <code>?</code>
will return early out of the whole function and give any <code>Err</code> value to the
calling code. The same thing applies to the <code>?</code> at the end of the
<code>read_to_string</code> call.</p>
<p>The <code>?</code> eliminates a lot of boilerplate and makes this function’s
implementation simpler. We could even shorten this code further by chaining
method calls immediately after the <code>?</code> as shown in Listing 9-8:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

    File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;)?.read_to_string(&amp;mut s)?;

    Ok(s)
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-8: Chaining method calls after the question

<p>We’ve moved the creation of the new <code>String</code> in <code>s</code> to the beginning of the
function; that part hasn’t changed. Instead of creating a variable <code>f</code>, we’ve
chained the call to <code>read_to_string</code> directly onto the result of
<code>File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;)?</code>. We still have a <code>?</code> at the end of the
<code>read_to_string</code> call, and we still return an <code>Ok</code> value containing the
username in <code>s</code> when both <code>File::open</code> and <code>read_to_string</code> succeed rather than
returning errors. The functionality is again the same as in Listing 9-6 and
Listing 9-7; this is just a different, more ergonomic way to write it.</p>

<p>The <code>?</code> can only be used in functions that have a return type of <code>Result</code>,
because it is defined to work in the same way as the <code>match</code> expression we
defined in Listing 9-6. The part of the <code>match</code> that requires a return type of
<code>Result</code> is <code>return Err(e)</code>, so the return type of the function must be a
<code>Result</code> to be compatible with this <code>return</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what happens if we use <code>?</code> in the <code>main</code> function, which you’ll
recall has a return type of <code>()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;)?;
}
</code></pre>
<p>When we compile this code, we get the following error message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0277]: the trait bound `(): std::ops::Try` is not satisfied

<p>This error points out that we’re only allowed to use the question mark operator
in a function that returns <code>Result</code>. In functions that don’t return <code>Result</code>,
when you call other functions that return <code>Result</code>, you’ll need to use a
<code>match</code> or one of the <code>Result</code> methods to handle it instead of using <code>?</code> to
potentially propagate the error to the calling code.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve discussed the details of calling <code>panic!</code> or returning <code>Result</code>,
let’s return to the topic of how to decide which is appropriate to use in which
cases.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#to-panic-or-not-to-panic" id="to-panic-or-not-to-panic"><h2>To <code>panic!</code> or Not to <code>panic!</code></h2></a>
<p>So how do you decide when you should <code>panic!</code> and when you should return
<code>Result</code>? When code panics, there’s no way to recover. You could call <code>panic!</code>
for any error situation, whether there’s a possible way to recover or not, but
then you’re making the decision on behalf of the code calling your code that a
situation is unrecoverable. When you choose to return a <code>Result</code> value, you
give the calling code options rather than making the decision for it. The
calling code could choose to attempt to recover in a way that’s appropriate for
its situation, or it could decide that an <code>Err</code> value in this case is
unrecoverable, so it can call <code>panic!</code> and turn your recoverable error into an
unrecoverable one. Therefore, returning <code>Result</code> is a good default choice when
you’re defining a function that might fail.</p>
<p>In a few situations it’s more appropriate to write code that panics instead of
returning a <code>Result</code>, but they are less common. Let’s explore why it’s
appropriate to panic in examples, prototype code, and tests; then in situations
where you as a human can know a method won’t fail that the compiler can’t
reason about; and conclude with some general guidelines on how to decide
whether to panic in library code.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#examples-prototype-code-and-tests-are-all-places-its-perfectly-fine-to-panic" id="examples-prototype-code-and-tests-are-all-places-its-perfectly-fine-to-panic"><h3>Examples, Prototype Code, and Tests Are All Places it’s Perfectly Fine to Panic</h3></a>
<p>When you’re writing an example to illustrate some concept, having robust error
handling code in the example as well can make the example less clear. In
examples, it’s understood that a call to a method like <code>unwrap</code> that could
<code>panic!</code> is meant as a placeholder for the way that you’d want your application
to handle errors, which can differ based on what the rest of your code is doing.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <code>unwrap</code> and <code>expect</code> methods are very handy when prototyping,
before you’re ready to decide how to handle errors. They leave clear markers in
your code for when you’re ready to make your program more robust.</p>
<p>If a method call fails in a test, we’d want the whole test to fail, even if
that method isn’t the functionality under test. Because <code>panic!</code> is how a test
is marked as a failure, calling <code>unwrap</code> or <code>expect</code> is exactly what should
happen.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#cases-when-you-have-more-information-than-the-compiler" id="cases-when-you-have-more-information-than-the-compiler"><h3>Cases When You Have More Information Than the Compiler</h3></a>
<p>It would also be appropriate to call <code>unwrap</code> when you have some other logic
that ensures the <code>Result</code> will have an <code>Ok</code> value, but the logic isn’t
something the compiler understands. You’ll still have a <code>Result</code> value that you
need to handle: whatever operation you’re calling still has the possibility of
failing in general, even though it’s logically impossible in your particular
situation. If you can ensure by manually inspecting the code that you’ll never
have an <code>Err</code> variant, it’s perfectly acceptable to call <code>unwrap</code>. Here’s an
example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::net::IpAddr;

let home = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;.parse::&lt;IpAddr&gt;().unwrap();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We’re creating an <code>IpAddr</code> instance by parsing a hardcoded string. We can see
that <code>127.0.0.1</code> is a valid IP address, so it’s acceptable to use <code>unwrap</code>
here. However, having a hardcoded, valid string doesn’t change the return type
of the <code>parse</code> method: we still get a <code>Result</code> value, and the compiler will
still make us handle the <code>Result</code> as if the <code>Err</code> variant is still a
possibility because the compiler isn’t smart enough to see that this string is
always a valid IP address. If the IP address string came from a user rather
than being hardcoded into the program, and therefore <em>did</em> have a possibility
of failure, we’d definitely want to handle the <code>Result</code> in a more robust way
instead.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#guidelines-for-error-handling" id="guidelines-for-error-handling"><h3>Guidelines for Error Handling</h3></a>
<p>It’s advisable to have your code <code>panic!</code> when it’s possible that your code
could end up in a bad state. In this context, bad state is when some
assumption, guarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such as when
invalid values, contradictory values, or missing values are passed to your
code—plus one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bad state is not something that’s <em>expected</em> to happen occasionally.</li>
<li>Your code after this point needs to rely on not being in this bad state.</li>
<li>There’s not a good way to encode this information in the types you use.</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone calls your code and passes in values that don’t make sense, the best
choice might be to <code>panic!</code> and alert the person using your library to the bug
in their code so they can fix it during development. Similarly, <code>panic!</code> is
often appropriate if you’re calling external code that is out of your control,
and it returns an invalid state that you have no way of fixing.</p>
<p>When a bad state is reached, but it’s expected to happen no matter how well you
write your code, it’s still more appropriate to return a <code>Result</code> rather than
making a <code>panic!</code> call. Examples of this include a parser being given malformed
data or an HTTP request returning a status that indicates you have hit a rate
limit. In these cases, you should indicate that failure is an expected
possibility by returning a <code>Result</code> to propagate these bad states upwards so
the calling code can decide how to handle the problem. To <code>panic!</code> wouldn’t be
the best way to handle these cases.</p>
<p>When your code performs operations on values, your code should verify the
values are valid first, and <code>panic!</code> if the values aren’t valid. This is mostly
for safety reasons: attempting to operate on invalid data can expose your code
to vulnerabilities. This is the main reason the standard library will <code>panic!</code>
if you attempt an out-of-bounds memory access: trying to access memory that
doesn’t belong to the current data structure is a common security problem.
Functions often have <em>contracts</em>: their behavior is only guaranteed if the
inputs meet particular requirements. Panicking when the contract is violated
makes sense because a contract violation always indicates a caller-side bug,
and it’s not a kind of error you want the calling code to have to explicitly
handle. In fact, there’s no reasonable way for calling code to recover: the
calling <em>programmers</em> need to fix the code. Contracts for a function,
especially when a violation will cause a panic, should be explained in the API
documentation for the function.</p>
<p>However, having lots of error checks in all of your functions would be verbose
and annoying. Fortunately, you can use Rust’s type system (and thus the type
checking the compiler does) to do many of the checks for you. If your function
has a particular type as a parameter, you can proceed with your code’s logic
knowing that the compiler has already ensured you have a valid value. For
example, if you have a type rather than an <code>Option</code>, your program expects to
have <em>something</em> rather than <em>nothing</em>. Your code then doesn’t have to handle
two cases for the <code>Some</code> and <code>None</code> variants: it will only have one case for
definitely having a value. Code trying to pass nothing to your function won’t
even compile, so your function doesn’t have to check for that case at runtime.
Another example is using an unsigned integer type like <code>u32</code>, which ensures the
parameter is never negative.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-custom-types-for-validation" id="creating-custom-types-for-validation"><h3>Creating Custom Types for Validation</h3></a>
<p>Let’s take the idea of using Rust’s type system to ensure we have a valid value
one step further and look at creating a custom type for validation. Recall the
guessing game in Chapter 2 where our code asked the user to guess a number
between 1 and 100. We never validated that the user’s guess was between those
numbers before checking it against our secret number; we only validated that
the guess was positive. In this case, the consequences were not very dire: our
output of “Too high” or “Too low” would still be correct. It would be a useful
enhancement to guide the user toward valid guesses and have different behavior
when a user guesses a number that’s out of range versus when a user types, for
example, letters instead.</p>
<p>One way to do this would be to parse the guess as an <code>i32</code> instead of only a
<code>u32</code> to allow potentially negative numbers, and then add a check for the
number being in range, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">loop {
    // --snip--

    let guess: i32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
        Ok(num) =&gt; num,
        Err(_) =&gt; continue,
    };

    if guess &lt; 1 || guess &gt; 100 {
        println!(&quot;The secret number will be between 1 and 100.&quot;);
        continue;
    }

    match guess.cmp(&amp;secret_number) {
    // --snip--
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>if</code> expression checks whether our value is out of range, tells the user
about the problem, and calls <code>continue</code> to start the next iteration of the loop
and ask for another guess. After the <code>if</code> expression, we can proceed with the
comparisons between <code>guess</code> and the secret number knowing that <code>guess</code> is
between 1 and 100.</p>
<p>However, this is not an ideal solution: if it was absolutely critical that the
program only operated on values between 1 and 100, and it had many functions
with this requirement, it would be tedious (and potentially impact performance)
to have a check like this in every function.</p>
<p>Instead, we can make a new type and put the validations in a function to create
an instance of the type rather than repeating the validations everywhere. That
way, it’s safe for functions to use the new type in their signatures and
confidently use the values they receive. Listing 9-9 shows one way to define a
<code>Guess</code> type that will only create an instance of <code>Guess</code> if the <code>new</code> function
receives a value between 1 and 100:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub struct Guess {
    value: u32,
}

impl Guess {
    pub fn new(value: u32) -&gt; Guess {
        if value &lt; 1 || value &gt; 100 {
            panic!(&quot;Guess value must be between 1 and 100, got {}.&quot;, value);
        }

        Guess {
            value
        }
    }

    pub fn value(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 {
        self.value
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-9: A <code>Guess</code> type that will only continue with
values between 1 and 100</span></p>
<p>First, we define a struct named <code>Guess</code> that has a field named <code>value</code> that
holds a <code>u32</code>. This is where the number will be stored.</p>
<p>Then we implement an associated function named <code>new</code> on <code>Guess</code> that creates
instances of <code>Guess</code> values. The <code>new</code> function is defined to have one
parameter named <code>value</code> of type <code>u32</code> and to return a <code>Guess</code>. The code in the
body of the <code>new</code> function tests <code>value</code> to make sure it’s between 1 and 100.
If <code>value</code> doesn’t pass this test, we make a <code>panic!</code> call, which will alert
the programmer who is writing the calling code that they have a bug they need
to fix, because creating a <code>Guess</code> with a <code>value</code> outside this range would
violate the contract that <code>Guess::new</code> is relying on. The conditions in which
<code>Guess::new</code> might panic should be discussed in its public-facing API
documentation; we’ll cover documentation conventions indicating the possibility
of a <code>panic!</code> in the API documentation that you create in Chapter 14. If
<code>value</code> does pass the test, we create a new <code>Guess</code> with its <code>value</code> field set
to the <code>value</code> parameter and return the <code>Guess</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we implement a method named <code>value</code> that borrows <code>self</code>, doesn’t have any
other parameters, and returns a <code>u32</code>. This is a kind of method sometimes
called a <em>getter</em>, because its purpose is to get some data from its fields and
return it. This public method is necessary because the <code>value</code> field of the
<code>Guess</code> struct is private. It’s important that the <code>value</code> field is private so
code using the <code>Guess</code> struct is not allowed to set <code>value</code> directly: code
outside the module <em>must</em> use the <code>Guess::new</code> function to create an instance
of <code>Guess</code>, which ensures there’s no way for a <code>Guess</code> to have a <code>value</code> that
hasn’t been checked by the conditions in the <code>Guess::new</code> function.</p>
<p>A function that has a parameter or returns only numbers between 1 and 100 could
then declare in its signature that it takes or returns a <code>Guess</code> rather than a
<code>u32</code> and wouldn’t need to do any additional checks in its body.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#summary-7" id="summary-7"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>Rust’s error handling features are designed to help you write more robust code.
The <code>panic!</code> macro signals that your program is in a state it can’t handle and
lets you tell the process to stop instead of trying to proceed with invalid or
incorrect values. The <code>Result</code> enum uses Rust’s type system to indicate that
operations might fail in a way that your code could recover from. You can use
<code>Result</code> to tell code that calls your code that it needs to handle potential
success or failure as well. Using <code>panic!</code> and <code>Result</code> in the appropriate
situations will make your code more reliable in the face of inevitable problems.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve seen useful ways that the standard library uses generics with
the <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> enums, we’ll talk about how generics work and how you
can use them in your code in the next chapter.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes" id="generic-types-traits-and-lifetimes"><h1>Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes</h1></a>
<p>Every programming language has tools to deal effectively with duplication of
concepts; in Rust, one of those tools is <em>generics</em>. Generics are abstract
stand-ins for concrete types or other properties. When we’re writing and
compiling the code we can express properties of generics, such as their
behavior or how they relate to other generics, without needing to know what
will actually be in their place.</p>
<p>In the same way that a function takes parameters whose value we don’t know in
order to write code once that will be run on multiple concrete values, we can
write functions that take parameters of some generic type instead of a concrete
type like <code>i32</code> or <code>String</code>. We’ve already used generics in Chapter 6 with
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, Chapter 8 with <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code>, and Chapter 9 with
<code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>. In this chapter, we’ll explore how to define our own types,
functions, and methods with generics!</p>
<p>First, we’re going to review the mechanics of extracting a function that
reduces code duplication. Then we’ll use the same mechanics to make a generic
function out of two functions that only differ in the types of their
parameters. We’ll go over using generic types in struct and enum definitions
too.</p>
<p>After that, we’ll discuss <em>traits</em>, which are a way to define behavior in a
generic way. Traits can be combined with generic types in order to constrain a
generic type to those types that have a particular behavior, rather than any
type at all.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll discuss <em>lifetimes</em>, which are a kind of generic that let us
give the compiler information about how references are related to each other.
Lifetimes are the feature in Rust that allow us to borrow values in many
situations and still have the compiler check that references will be valid.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#removing-duplication-by-extracting-a-function" id="removing-duplication-by-extracting-a-function"><h2>Removing Duplication by Extracting a Function</h2></a>
<p>Before getting into generics syntax, let’s first review a technique for dealing
with duplication that doesn’t use generic types: extracting a function. Once
that’s fresh in our minds, we’ll use the same mechanics with generics to
extract a generic function! In the same way that you recognize duplicated code
to extract into a function, you’ll start to recognize duplicated code that can
use generics.</p>
<p>Consider a small program that finds the largest number in a list, shown in
Listing 10-1:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let mut largest = number_list[0];

    for number in number_list {
        if number &gt; largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!(&quot;The largest number is {}&quot;, largest);
#  assert_eq!(largest, 100);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-1: Code to find the largest number in a list
of numbers</span></p>
<p>This code takes a list of integers, stored here in the variable <code>number_list</code>. It
puts the first item in the list in a variable named <code>largest</code>. Then it iterates
through all the numbers in the list, and if the current value is greater than
the number stored in <code>largest</code>, it replaces the value in <code>largest</code>. If the
current value is smaller than the largest value seen so far, <code>largest</code> is not
changed. When all the items in the list have been considered, <code>largest</code> will
hold the largest value, which in this case is 100.</p>
<p>If we needed to find the largest number in two different lists of numbers, we
could duplicate the code in Listing 10-1 and have the same logic exist in two
places in the program, as in Listing 10-2:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let mut largest = number_list[0];

    for number in number_list {
        if number &gt; largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!(&quot;The largest number is {}&quot;, largest);

    let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];

    let mut largest = number_list[0];

    for number in number_list {
        if number &gt; largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!(&quot;The largest number is {}&quot;, largest);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-2: Code to find the largest number in <em>two</em>
lists of numbers</span></p>
<p>While this code works, duplicating code is tedious and error-prone, and means
we have multiple places to update the logic if we need to change it.</p>
<!-- Are we safe assuming the reader will be familiar with the term
"abstraction" in this context, or do we want to give a brief definition? -->
<!-- Yes, our audience will be familiar with this term. /Carol -->
<p>To eliminate this duplication, we can create an abstraction, which in this case
will be in the form of a function that operates on any list of integers given
to the function in a parameter. This will increase the clarity of our code and
let us communicate and reason about the concept of finding the largest number
in a list independently of the specific places this concept is used.</p>
<p>In the program in Listing 10-3, we’ve extracted the code that finds the largest
number into a function named <code>largest</code>. This program can find the largest
number in two different lists of numbers, but the code from Listing 10-1 only
exists in one spot:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn largest(list: &amp;[i32]) -&gt; i32 {
    let mut largest = list[0];

    for &amp;item in list.iter() {
        if item &gt; largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&amp;number_list);
    println!(&quot;The largest number is {}&quot;, result);
#    assert_eq!(result, 100);

    let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];

    let result = largest(&amp;number_list);
    println!(&quot;The largest number is {}&quot;, result);
#    assert_eq!(result, 6000);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-3: Abstracted code to find the largest number
in two lists</span></p>
<p>The function has a parameter, <code>list</code>, which represents any concrete slice of
<code>i32</code> values that we might pass into the function. The code in the function
definition operates on the <code>list</code> representation of any <code>&amp;[i32]</code>. When we call
the <code>largest</code> function, the code actually runs on the specific values that we
pass in.</p>
<p>The mechanics we went through to get from Listing 10-2 to Listing 10-3 were
these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>We noticed there was duplicate code.</li>
<li>We extracted the duplicate code into the body of the function, and specified
the inputs and return values of that code in the function signature.</li>
<li>We replaced the two concrete places that had the duplicated code to call the
function instead.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can use these same steps with generics to reduce code duplication in
different ways in different scenarios. In the same way that the function body
is now operating on an abstract <code>list</code> instead of concrete values, code using
generics will operate on abstract types. The concepts powering generics are the
same concepts you already know that power functions, just applied in different
ways.</p>
<p>What if we had two functions, one that found the largest item in a slice of
<code>i32</code> values and one that found the largest item in a slice of <code>char</code> values?
How would we get rid of that duplication? Let’s find out!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#generic-data-types" id="generic-data-types"><h2>Generic Data Types</h2></a>
<p>Using generics where we usually place types, like in function signatures or
structs, lets us create definitions that we can use for many different concrete
data types. Let’s take a look at how to define functions, structs, enums, and
methods using generics, and at the end of this section we’ll discuss the
performance of code using generics.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-generic-data-types-in-function-definitions" id="using-generic-data-types-in-function-definitions"><h3>Using Generic Data Types in Function Definitions</h3></a>
<p>We can define functions that use generics in the signature of the function
where the data types of the parameters and return value go. In this way, the
code we write can be more flexible and provide more functionality to callers of
our function, while not introducing code duplication.</p>
<p>Continuing with our <code>largest</code> function, Listing 10-4 shows two functions
providing the same functionality to find the largest value in a slice. The
first function is the one we extracted in Listing 10-3 that finds the largest
<code>i32</code> in a slice. The second function finds the largest <code>char</code> in a slice:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn largest_i32(list: &amp;[i32]) -&gt; i32 {

    for &amp;item in list.iter() {
        if item &gt; largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn largest_char(list: &amp;[char]) -&gt; char {
    let mut largest = list[0];

    for &amp;item in list.iter() {
        if item &gt; largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest_i32(&amp;number_list);
    println!(&quot;The largest number is {}&quot;, result);
#    assert_eq!(result, 100);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest_char(&amp;char_list);
    println!(&quot;The largest char is {}&quot;, result);
#    assert_eq!(result, 'y');
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-4: Two functions that differ only in their
names and the types in their signatures</span></p>
<p>Here, the functions <code>largest_i32</code> and <code>largest_char</code> have the exact same body,
so it would be nice if we could turn these two functions into one and get rid
of the duplication. Luckily, we can do that by introducing a generic type
parameter!</p>
<p>To parameterize the types in the signature of the one function we’re going to
define, we need to create a name for the type parameter, just like how we give
names for the value parameters to a function. We’re going to choose the name
<code>T</code>. Any identifier can be used as a type parameter name, but we’re choosing
<code>T</code> because Rust’s type naming convention is CamelCase. Generic type parameter
names also tend to be short by convention, often just one letter. Short for
“type”, <code>T</code> is the default choice of most Rust programmers.</p>
<p>When we use a parameter in the body of the function, we have to declare the
parameter in the signature so that the compiler knows what that name in the
body means. Similarly, when we use a type parameter name in a function
signature, we have to declare the type parameter name before we use it. Type
name declarations go in angle brackets between the name of the function and the
parameter list.</p>
<p>The function signature of the generic <code>largest</code> function we’re going to define
will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn largest&lt;T&gt;(list: &amp;[T]) -&gt; T {
</code></pre>
<p>We would read this as: the function <code>largest</code> is generic over some type <code>T</code>. It
has one parameter named <code>list</code>, and the type of <code>list</code> is a slice of values of
type <code>T</code>. The <code>largest</code> function will return a value of the same type <code>T</code>.</p>
<p>Listing 10-5 shows the unified <code>largest</code> function definition using the generic
data type in its signature, and shows how we’ll be able to call <code>largest</code> with
either a slice of <code>i32</code> values or <code>char</code> values. Note that this code won’t
compile yet!</p>

<p>The note mentions <code>std::cmp::PartialOrd</code>, which is a <em>trait</em>. We’re going to
talk about traits in the next section, but briefly, what this error is saying
is that the body of <code>largest</code> won’t work for all possible types that <code>T</code> could
be; since we want to compare values of type <code>T</code> in the body, we can only use
types that know how to be ordered. The standard library has defined the trait
<code>std::cmp::PartialOrd</code> that types can implement to enable comparisons. We’ll
come back to traits and how to specify that a generic type has a particular
trait in the next section, but let’s set this example aside for a moment and
explore other places we can use generic type parameters first.</p>
<!-- Liz: this is the reason we had the topics in the order we did in the first
draft of this chapter; it's hard to do anything interesting with generic types
in functions unless you also know about traits and trait bounds. I think this
ordering could work out okay, though, and keep a stronger thread with the
`longest` function going through the whole chapter, but we do pause with a
not-yet-compiling example here, which I know isn't ideal either. Let us know
what you think. /Carol -->

<p>We can define structs to use a generic type parameter in one or more of the
struct’s fields with the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> syntax too. Listing 10-6 shows the definition and
use of a <code>Point</code> struct that can hold <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinate values of any type:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">struct Point&lt;T&gt; {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-6: A <code>Point</code> struct that holds <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
values of type <code>T</code></span></p>
<p>The syntax is similar to using generics in function definitions. First, we have
to declare the name of the type parameter within angle brackets just after the
name of the struct. Then we can use the generic type in the struct definition
where we would specify concrete data types.</p>
<p>Note that because we’ve only used one generic type in the definition of
<code>Point</code>, what we’re saying is that the <code>Point</code> struct is generic over some type
<code>T</code>, and the fields <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are <em>both</em> that same type, whatever it ends up
being. If we try to create an instance of a <code>Point</code> that has values of
different types, as in Listing 10-7, our code won’t compile:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Point&lt;T&gt; {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let wont_work = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-7: The fields <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> must be the same
type because both have the same generic data type <code>T</code></span></p>
<p>If we try to compile this, we’ll get the following error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --&gt;
  |
7 |     let wont_work = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };

  floating-point variable
  |
  = note: expected type `{integer}`
  = note:    found type `{float}`
</code></pre>
<p>When we assigned the integer value 5 to <code>x</code>, the compiler then knows for this
instance of <code>Point</code> that the generic type <code>T</code> will be an integer. Then when we
specified 4.0 for <code>y</code>, which is defined to have the same type as <code>x</code>, we get a
type mismatch error.</p>
<p>If we wanted to define a <code>Point</code> struct where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> could have different
types but still have those types be generic, we can use multiple generic type
parameters. In listing 10-8, we’ve changed the definition of <code>Point</code> to be
generic over types <code>T</code> and <code>U</code>. The field <code>x</code> is of type <code>T</code>, and the field <code>y</code>
is of type <code>U</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">struct Point&lt;T, U&gt; {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

fn main() {
    let both_integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let both_float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
    let integer_and_float = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-8: A <code>Point</code> generic over two types so that
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> may be values of different types</span></p>
<p>Now all of these instances of <code>Point</code> are allowed! You can use as many generic
type parameters in a definition as you want, but using more than a few gets
hard to read and understand. If you get to a point of needing lots of generic
types, it’s probably a sign that your code could use some restructuring to be
separated into smaller pieces.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-generic-data-types-in-enum-definitions" id="using-generic-data-types-in-enum-definitions"><h3>Using Generic Data Types in Enum Definitions</h3></a>
<p>Similarly to structs, enums can be defined to hold generic data types in their
variants. We used the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum provided by the standard library in
Chapter 6, and now its definition should make more sense. Let’s take another
look:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum Option&lt;T&gt; {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In other words, <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is an enum generic in type <code>T</code>. It has two
variants: <code>Some</code>, which holds one value of type <code>T</code>, and a <code>None</code> variant that
doesn’t hold any value. The standard library only has to have this one
definition to support the creation of values of this enum that have any
concrete type. The idea of “an optional value” is a more abstract concept than
one specific type, and Rust lets us express this abstract concept without lots
of duplication.</p>
<p>Enums can use multiple generic types as well. The definition of the <code>Result</code>
enum that we used in Chapter 9 is one example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum Result&lt;T, E&gt; {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>Result</code> enum is generic over two types, <code>T</code> and <code>E</code>. <code>Result</code> has two
variants: <code>Ok</code>, which holds a value of type <code>T</code>, and <code>Err</code>, which holds a value
of type <code>E</code>. This definition makes it convenient to use the <code>Result</code> enum
anywhere we have an operation that might succeed (and return a value of some
type <code>T</code>) or fail (and return an error of some type <code>E</code>). Recall Listing 9-2
when we opened a file: in that case, <code>T</code> was filled in with the type
<code>std::fs::File</code> when the file was opened successfully and <code>E</code> was filled in
with the type <code>std::io::Error</code> when there were problems opening the file.</p>
<p>When you recognize situations in your code with multiple struct or enum
definitions that differ only in the types of the values they hold, you can
remove the duplication by using the same process we used with the function
definitions to introduce generic types instead.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-generic-data-types-in-method-definitions" id="using-generic-data-types-in-method-definitions"><h3>Using Generic Data Types in Method Definitions</h3></a>
<p>Like we did in Chapter 5, we can implement methods on structs and enums that
have generic types in their definitions. Listing 10-9 shows the <code>Point&lt;T&gt;</code>
struct we defined in Listing 10-6. We’ve then defined a method named <code>x</code> on
<code>Point&lt;T&gt;</code> that returns a reference to the data in the field <code>x</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">struct Point&lt;T&gt; {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl&lt;T&gt; Point&lt;T&gt; {
    fn x(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;T {
        &amp;self.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!(&quot;p.x = {}&quot;, p.x());
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-9: Implementing a method named <code>x</code> on the
<code>Point&lt;T&gt;</code> struct that will return a reference to the <code>x</code> field, which is of
type <code>T</code>.</span></p>
<p>Note that we have to declare <code>T</code> just after <code>impl</code> in order to use <code>T</code> in the
type <code>Point&lt;T&gt;</code>. Declaring <code>T</code> as a generic type after the <code>impl</code> is how Rust
knows the type in the angle brackets in <code>Point</code> is a generic type rather than a
concrete type. For example, we could choose to implement methods on
<code>Point&lt;f32&gt;</code> instances rather than <code>Point</code> instances with any generic type.
Listing 10-10 shows that we don’t declare anything after the <code>impl</code> in this
case, since we’re using a concrete type, <code>f32</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# struct Point&lt;T&gt; {
#     x: T,
#     y: T,
# }
#
impl Point&lt;f32&gt; {
    fn distance_from_origin(&amp;self) -&gt; f32 {
        (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-10: Building an <code>impl</code> block which only
applies to a struct with a specific type is used for the generic type parameter
<code>T</code></span></p>
<p>This code means the type <code>Point&lt;f32&gt;</code> will have a method named
<code>distance_from_origin</code>, and other instances of <code>Point&lt;T&gt;</code> where <code>T</code> is not of
type <code>f32</code> will not have this method defined. This method measures how far our
point is from the point of coordinates (0.0, 0.0) and uses mathematical
operations which are only available for floating-point types.</p>
<p>Generic type parameters in a struct definition aren’t always the same generic
type parameters you want to use in that struct’s method signatures. Listing
10-11 defines a method <code>mixup</code> on the <code>Point&lt;T, U&gt;</code> struct from Listing 10-8.
The method takes another <code>Point</code> as a parameter, which might have different
types than the <code>self</code> <code>Point</code> that we’re calling <code>mixup</code> on. The method creates
a new <code>Point</code> instance that has the <code>x</code> value from the <code>self</code> <code>Point</code> (which is
of type <code>T</code>) and the <code>y</code> value from the passed-in <code>Point</code> (which is of type
<code>W</code>):</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">struct Point&lt;T, U&gt; {

}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point { x: 5, y: 10.4 };
    let p2 = Point { x: &quot;Hello&quot;, y: 'c'};

    let p3 = p1.mixup(p2);

    println!(&quot;p3.x = {}, p3.y = {}&quot;, p3.x, p3.y);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-11: Methods that use different generic types
than their struct’s definition</span></p>
<p>In <code>main</code>, we’ve defined a <code>Point</code> that has an <code>i32</code> for <code>x</code> (with value <code>5</code>)
and an <code>f64</code> for <code>y</code> (with value <code>10.4</code>). <code>p2</code> is a <code>Point</code> that has a string
slice for <code>x</code> (with value <code>&quot;Hello&quot;</code>) and a <code>char</code> for <code>y</code> (with value <code>c</code>).
Calling <code>mixup</code> on <code>p1</code> with the argument <code>p2</code> gives us <code>p3</code>, which will have
an <code>i32</code> for <code>x</code>, since <code>x</code> came from <code>p1</code>. <code>p3</code> will have a <code>char</code> for <code>y</code>,
since <code>y</code> came from <code>p2</code>. The <code>println!</code> will print <code>p3.x = 5, p3.y = c</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the generic parameters <code>T</code> and <code>U</code> are declared after <code>impl</code>, since
they go with the struct definition. The generic parameters <code>V</code> and <code>W</code> are
declared after <code>fn mixup</code>, since they are only relevant to the method.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#performance-of-code-using-generics" id="performance-of-code-using-generics"><h3>Performance of Code Using Generics</h3></a>
<p>You may have been reading this section and wondering if there’s a run-time cost
to using generic type parameters. Good news: the way that Rust has implemented
generics means that your code will not run any slower than if you had specified
concrete types instead of generic type parameters!</p>
<p>Rust accomplishes this by performing <em>monomorphization</em> of code using generics
at compile time. Monomorphization is the process of turning generic code into
specific code with the concrete types that are actually used filled in.</p>
<p>What the compiler does is the opposite of the steps that we performed to create
the generic function in Listing 10-5. The compiler looks at all the places that
generic code is called and generates code for the concrete types that the
generic code is called with.</p>
<p>Let’s work through an example that uses the standard library’s <code>Option</code> enum:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let integer = Some(5);
let float = Some(5.0);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>When Rust compiles this code, it will perform monomorphization. The compiler
will read the values that have been passed to <code>Option</code> and see that we have two
kinds of <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>: one is <code>i32</code>, and one is <code>f64</code>. As such, it will expand
the generic definition of <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> into <code>Option_i32</code> and <code>Option_f64</code>,
thereby replacing the generic definition with the specific ones.</p>
<p>The monomorphized version of our code that the compiler generates looks like
this, with the uses of the generic <code>Option</code> replaced with the specific
definitions created by the compiler:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">enum Option_i32 {
    Some(i32),
    None,
}

enum Option_f64 {
    Some(f64),
    None,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Option_i32::Some(5);
    let float = Option_f64::Some(5.0);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>We can write the non-duplicated code using generics, and Rust will compile that
into code that specifies the type in each instance. That means we pay no
runtime cost for using generics; when the code runs, it performs just like it
would if we had duplicated each particular definition by hand. The process of
monomorphization is what makes Rust’s generics extremely efficient at runtime.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#traits-defining-shared-behavior" id="traits-defining-shared-behavior"><h2>Traits: Defining Shared Behavior</h2></a>
<p>Traits allow us to use another kind of abstraction: they let us abstract over
behavior that types can have in common. A <em>trait</em> tells the Rust compiler about
functionality a particular type has and might share with other types. In
situations where we use generic type parameters, we can use <em>trait bounds</em> to
specify, at compile time, that the generic type may be any type that implements
a trait and therefore has the behavior we want to use in that situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: <em>Traits</em> are similar to a feature often called ‘interfaces’ in other
languages, though with some differences.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#defining-a-trait" id="defining-a-trait"><h3>Defining a Trait</h3></a>
<p>The behavior of a type consists of the methods we can call on that type.
Different types share the same behavior if we can call the same methods on all
of those types. Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures together
in order to define a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose.</p>
<p>For example, say we have multiple structs that hold various kinds and amounts
of text: a <code>NewsArticle</code> struct that holds a news story filed in a particular
place in the world, and a <code>Tweet</code> that can have at most 140 characters in its
content along with metadata like whether it was a retweet or a reply to another
tweet.</p>
<p>We want to make a media aggregator library that can display summaries of data
that might be stored in a <code>NewsArticle</code> or <code>Tweet</code> instance. The behavior we
need each struct to have is that it’s able to be summarized, and that we can
ask for that summary by calling a <code>summary</code> method on an instance. Listing
10-12 shows the definition of a <code>Summarizable</code> trait that expresses this
concept:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub trait Summarizable {
    fn summary(&amp;self) -&gt; String;
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-12: Definition of a <code>Summarizable</code> trait that
consists of the behavior provided by a <code>summary</code> method</span></p>
<p>We declare a trait with the <code>trait</code> keyword, then the trait’s name, in this
case <code>Summarizable</code>. Inside curly brackets we declare the method signatures
that describe the behaviors that types that implement this trait will need to
have, in this case <code>fn summary(&amp;self) -&gt; String</code>. After the method signature,
instead of providing an implementation within curly brackets, we put a
semicolon. Each type that implements this trait must then provide its own
custom behavior for the body of the method, but the compiler will enforce that
any type that has the <code>Summarizable</code> trait will have the method <code>summary</code>
defined for it with this signature exactly.</p>
<p>A trait can have multiple methods in its body, with the method signatures
listed one per line and each line ending in a semicolon.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#implementing-a-trait-on-a-type" id="implementing-a-trait-on-a-type"><h3>Implementing a Trait on a Type</h3></a>
<p>Now that we’ve defined the <code>Summarizable</code> trait, we can implement it on the
types in our media aggregator that we want to have this behavior. Listing 10-13
shows an implementation of the <code>Summarizable</code> trait on the <code>NewsArticle</code> struct
that uses the headline, the author, and the location to create the return value
of <code>summary</code>. For the <code>Tweet</code> struct, we’ve chosen to define <code>summary</code> as the
username followed by the whole text of the tweet, assuming that tweet content
is already limited to 140 characters.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">

    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-13: Implementing the <code>Summarizable</code> trait on
the <code>NewsArticle</code> and <code>Tweet</code> types</span></p>
<p>Implementing a trait on a type is similar to implementing methods that aren’t
related to a trait. The difference is after <code>impl</code>, we put the trait name that
we want to implement, then say <code>for</code> and the name of the type that we want to
implement the trait for. Within the <code>impl</code> block, we put the method signatures
that the trait definition has defined, but instead of putting a semicolon after
each signature, we put curly brackets and fill in the method body with the
specific behavior that we want the methods of the trait to have for the
particular type.</p>
<p>Once we’ve implemented the trait, we can call the methods on instances of
<code>NewsArticle</code> and <code>Tweet</code> in the same manner that we call methods that aren’t
part of a trait:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let tweet = Tweet {
    username: String::from(&quot;horse_ebooks&quot;),
    content: String::from(&quot;of course, as you probably already know, people&quot;),
    reply: false,
    retweet: false,
};

println!(&quot;1 new tweet: {}&quot;, tweet.summary());
</code></pre>
<p>This will print <code>1 new tweet: horse_ebooks: of course, as you probably already know, people</code>.</p>
<p>Note that because we’ve defined the <code>Summarizable</code> trait and the <code>NewsArticle</code>
and <code>Tweet</code> types all in the same <code>lib.rs</code> in Listing 10-13, they’re all in the
same scope. If this <code>lib.rs</code> is for a crate we’ve called <code>aggregator</code>, and
someone else wants to use our crate’s functionality plus implement the
<code>Summarizable</code> trait on their <code>WeatherForecast</code> struct, their code would need
to import the <code>Summarizable</code> trait into their scope first before they could
implement it, like in Listing 10-14:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate aggregator;

use aggregator::Summarizable;

struct WeatherForecast {
    high_temp: f64,
    low_temp: f64,
    chance_of_precipitation: f64,
}

impl Summarizable for WeatherForecast {
    fn summary(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
        format!(&quot;The high will be {}, and the low will be {}. The chance of
        precipitation is {}%.&quot;, self.high_temp, self.low_temp,
        self.chance_of_precipitation)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-14: Bringing the <code>Summarizable</code> trait from our
<code>aggregator</code> crate into scope in another crate</span></p>
<p>This code also assumes <code>Summarizable</code> is a public trait, which it is because we
put the <code>pub</code> keyword before <code>trait</code> in Listing 10-12.</p>
<p>One restriction to note with trait implementations: we may implement a trait on
a type as long as either the trait or the type are local to our crate. In other
words, we aren’t allowed to implement external traits on external types. We
can’t implement the <code>Display</code> trait on <code>Vec</code>, for example, since both <code>Display</code>
and <code>Vec</code> are defined in the standard library. We are allowed to implement
standard library traits like <code>Display</code> on a custom type like <code>Tweet</code> as part of
our <code>aggregator</code> crate functionality. We could also implement <code>Summarizable</code> on
<code>Vec</code> in our <code>aggregator</code> crate, since we’ve defined <code>Summarizable</code> there. This
restriction is part of what’s called the <em>orphan rule</em>, which you can look up
if you’re interested in type theory. Briefly, it’s called the orphan rule
because the parent type is not present. Without this rule, two crates could
implement the same trait for the same type, and the two implementations would
conflict: Rust wouldn’t know which implementation to use. Because Rust enforces
the orphan rule, other people’s code can’t break your code and vice versa.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#default-implementations" id="default-implementations"><h3>Default Implementations</h3></a>
<p>Sometimes it’s useful to have default behavior for some or all of the methods
in a trait, instead of making every implementation on every type define custom
behavior. When we implement the trait on a particular type, we can choose to
keep or override each method’s default behavior.</p>
<p>Listing 10-15 shows how we could have chosen to specify a default string for
the <code>summary</code> method of the <code>Summarize</code> trait instead of choosing to only
define the method signature like we did in Listing 10-12:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub trait Summarizable {
    fn summary(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
        String::from(&quot;(Read more...)&quot;)
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-15: Definition of a <code>Summarizable</code> trait with
a default implementation of the <code>summary</code> method</span></p>
<p>If we wanted to use this default implementation to summarize instances of
<code>NewsArticle</code> instead of defining a custom implementation like we did in
Listing 10-13, we would specify an empty <code>impl</code> block:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl Summarizable for NewsArticle {}
</code></pre>
<p>Even though we’re no longer choosing to define the <code>summary</code> method on
<code>NewsArticle</code> directly, since the <code>summary</code> method has a default implementation
and we specified that <code>NewsArticle</code> implements the <code>Summarizable</code> trait, we can
still call the <code>summary</code> method on an instance of <code>NewsArticle</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let article = NewsArticle {
    headline: String::from(&quot;Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!&quot;),
    location: String::from(&quot;Pittsburgh, PA, USA&quot;),
    author: String::from(&quot;Iceburgh&quot;),
    content: String::from(&quot;The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best
    hockey team in the NHL.&quot;),
};

println!(&quot;New article available! {}&quot;, article.summary());
</code></pre>
<p>This code prints <code>New article available! (Read more...)</code>.</p>
<p>Changing the <code>Summarizable</code> trait to have a default implementation for
<code>summary</code> does not require us to change anything about the implementations of
<code>Summarizable</code> on <code>Tweet</code> in Listing 10-13 or <code>WeatherForecast</code> in Listing
10-14: the syntax for overriding a default implementation is exactly the same
as the syntax for implementing a trait method that doesn’t have a default
implementation.</p>
<p>Default implementations are allowed to call the other methods in the same
trait, even if those other methods don’t have a default implementation. In this
way, a trait can provide a lot of useful functionality and only require
implementors to specify a small part of it. We could choose to have the
<code>Summarizable</code> trait also have an <code>author_summary</code> method whose implementation
is required, then a <code>summary</code> method that has a default implementation that
calls the <code>author_summary</code> method:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub trait Summarizable {
    fn author_summary(&amp;self) -&gt; String;

    fn summary(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
        format!(&quot;(Read more from {}...)&quot;, self.author_summary())
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In order to use this version of <code>Summarizable</code>, we’re only required to define
<code>author_summary</code> when we implement the trait on a type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl Summarizable for Tweet {
    fn author_summary(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
        format!(&quot;@{}&quot;, self.username)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Once we define <code>author_summary</code>, we can call <code>summary</code> on instances of the
<code>Tweet</code> struct, and the default implementation of <code>summary</code> will call the
definition of <code>author_summary</code> that we’ve provided.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let tweet = Tweet {
    username: String::from(&quot;horse_ebooks&quot;),
    content: String::from(&quot;of course, as you probably already know, people&quot;),
    reply: false,
    retweet: false,
};

println!(&quot;1 new tweet: {}&quot;, tweet.summary());
</code></pre>
<p>This will print <code>1 new tweet: (Read more from @horse_ebooks...)</code>.</p>
<p>Note that it is not possible to call the default implementation from an
overriding implementation.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#trait-bounds" id="trait-bounds"><h3>Trait Bounds</h3></a>
<p>Now that we’ve defined traits and implemented those traits on types, we can use
traits with generic type parameters. We can constrain generic types so that
rather than being any type, the compiler will ensure that the type will be
limited to those types that implement a particular trait and thus have the
behavior that we need the types to have. This is called specifying <em>trait
bounds</em> on a generic type.</p>
<p>For example, in Listing 10-13, we implemented the <code>Summarizable</code> trait on the
types <code>NewsArticle</code> and <code>Tweet</code>. We can define a function <code>notify</code> that calls
the <code>summary</code> method on its parameter <code>item</code>, which is of the generic type <code>T</code>.
To be able to call <code>summary</code> on <code>item</code> without getting an error, we can use
trait bounds on <code>T</code> to specify that <code>item</code> must be of a type that implements
the <code>Summarizable</code> trait:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn notify&lt;T: Summarizable&gt;(item: T) {
    println!(&quot;Breaking news! {}&quot;, item.summary());
}
</code></pre>
<p>Trait bounds go with the declaration of the generic type parameter, after a
colon and within the angle brackets. Because of the trait bound on <code>T</code>, we can
call <code>notify</code> and pass in any instance of <code>NewsArticle</code> or <code>Tweet</code>. The
external code from Listing 10-14 that’s using our <code>aggregator</code> crate can call
our <code>notify</code> function and pass in an instance of <code>WeatherForecast</code>, since
<code>Summarizable</code> is implemented for <code>WeatherForecast</code> as well. Code that calls
<code>notify</code> with any other type, like a <code>String</code> or an <code>i32</code>, won’t compile, since
those types do not implement <code>Summarizable</code>.</p>
<p>We can specify multiple trait bounds on a generic type by using <code>+</code>. If we
needed to be able to use display formatting on the type <code>T</code> in a function as
well as the <code>summary</code> method, we can use the trait bounds <code>T: Summarizable + Display</code>. This means <code>T</code> can be any type that implements both <code>Summarizable</code>
and <code>Display</code>.</p>
<p>For functions that have multiple generic type parameters, each generic has its
own trait bounds. Specifying lots of trait bound information in the angle
brackets between a function’s name and its parameter list can get hard to read,
so there’s an alternate syntax for specifying trait bounds that lets us move
them to a <code>where</code> clause after the function signature. So instead of:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn some_function&lt;T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug&gt;(t: T, u: U) -&gt; i32 {
</code></pre>
<p>We can write this instead with a <code>where</code> clause:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn some_function&lt;T, U&gt;(t: T, u: U) -&gt; i32
    where T: Display + Clone,
          U: Clone + Debug
{
</code></pre>
<p>This is less cluttered and makes this function’s signature look more similar to
a function without lots of trait bounds, in that the function name, parameter
list, and return type are close together.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#fixing-the-largest-function-with-trait-bounds" id="fixing-the-largest-function-with-trait-bounds"><h3>Fixing the <code>largest</code> Function with Trait Bounds</h3></a>
<p>So any time you want to use behavior defined by a trait on a generic, you need
to specify that trait in the generic type parameter’s type bounds. We can now
fix the definition of the <code>largest</code> function that uses a generic type parameter
from Listing 10-5! When we set that code aside, we were getting this error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0369]: binary operation `&gt;` cannot be applied to type `T`

<p>In the body of <code>largest</code> we wanted to be able to compare two values of type <code>T</code>
using the greater-than operator. That operator is defined as a default method
on the standard library trait <code>std::cmp::PartialOrd</code>. So in order to be able to
use the greater-than operator, we need to specify <code>PartialOrd</code> in the trait
bounds for <code>T</code> so that the <code>largest</code> function will work on slices of any type
that can be compared. We don’t need to bring <code>PartialOrd</code> into scope because
it’s in the prelude.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn largest&lt;T: PartialOrd&gt;(list: &amp;[T]) -&gt; T {

<p>If we try to compile this, we’ll get different errors:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The key to this error is <code>cannot move out of type [T], a non-copy array</code>.
With our non-generic versions of the <code>largest</code> function, we were only trying to
find the largest <code>i32</code> or <code>char</code>. As we discussed in Chapter 4, types like
<code>i32</code> and <code>char</code> that have a known size can be stored on the stack, so they
implement the <code>Copy</code> trait. When we changed the <code>largest</code> function to be
generic, it’s now possible that the <code>list</code> parameter could have types in it
that don’t implement the <code>Copy</code> trait, which means we wouldn’t be able to move
the value out of <code>list[0]</code> and into the <code>largest</code> variable.</p>
<p>If we only want to be able to call this code with types that are <code>Copy</code>, we can
add <code>Copy</code> to the trait bounds of <code>T</code>! Listing 10-16 shows the complete code of
a generic <code>largest</code> function that will compile as long as the types of the
values in the slice that we pass into <code>largest</code> implement both the <code>PartialOrd</code>
and <code>Copy</code> traits, like <code>i32</code> and <code>char</code>:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-16: A working definition of the <code>largest</code>
function that works on any generic type that implements the <code>PartialOrd</code> and

<p>If we don’t want to restrict our <code>largest</code> function to only types that
implement the <code>Copy</code> trait, we could specify that <code>T</code> has the trait bound
<code>Clone</code> instead of <code>Copy</code> and clone each value in the slice when we want the
<code>largest</code> function to have ownership. Using the <code>clone</code> function means we’re
potentially making more heap allocations, though, and heap allocations can be
slow if we’re working with large amounts of data. Another way we could
implement <code>largest</code> is for the function to return a reference to a <code>T</code> value in
the slice. If we change the return type to be <code>&amp;T</code> instead of <code>T</code> and change
the body of the function to return a reference, we wouldn’t need either the
<code>Clone</code> or <code>Copy</code> trait bounds and we wouldn’t be doing any heap allocations.

<a class="header" href="print.html#using-trait-bounds-to-conditionally-implement-methods" id="using-trait-bounds-to-conditionally-implement-methods"><h3>Using Trait Bounds to Conditionally Implement Methods</h3></a>
<p>By using a trait bound with an <code>impl</code> block that uses generic type parameters,
we can conditionally implement methods only for types that implement the
specified traits. For example, the type <code>Pair&lt;T&gt;</code> in listing 10-17 always
implements the <code>new</code> method, but <code>Pair&lt;T&gt;</code> only implements the <code>cmp_display</code> if
its inner type <code>T</code> implements the <code>PartialOrd</code> trait that enables comparison
and the <code>Display</code> trait that enables printing:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::fmt::Display;

struct Pair&lt;T&gt; {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl&lt;T&gt; Pair&lt;T&gt; {
    fn new(x: T, y: T) -&gt; Self {
        Self {
            x,
            y,
        }
    }
}

impl&lt;T: Display + PartialOrd&gt; Pair&lt;T&gt; {
    fn cmp_display(&amp;self) {
        if self.x &gt;= self.y {
            println!(&quot;The largest member is x = {}&quot;, self.x);
        } else {
            println!(&quot;The largest member is y = {}&quot;, self.y);
        }
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-17: Conditionally implement methods on a
generic type depending on trait bounds</span></p>
<p>We can also conditionally implement a trait for any type that implements a
trait. Implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies the trait bounds
are called <em>blanket implementations</em>, and are extensively used in the Rust
standard library. For example, the standard library implements the <code>ToString</code>
trait on any type that implements the <code>Display</code> trait. This <code>impl</code> block looks
similar to this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;T: Display&gt; ToString for T {
    // --snip--
}
</code></pre>
<p>Because the standard library has this blanket implementation, we can call the
<code>to_string</code> method defined by the <code>ToString</code> type on any type that implements
the <code>Display</code> trait. For example, we can turn integers into their corresponding
<code>String</code> values like this since integers implement <code>Display</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let s = 3.to_string();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Blanket implementations appear in the documentation for the trait in the
“Implementors” section.</p>
<p>Traits and trait bounds let us write code that uses generic type parameters in
order to reduce duplication, but still specify to the compiler exactly what
behavior our code needs the generic type to have. Because we’ve given the trait
bound information to the compiler, it can check that all the concrete types
used with our code provide the right behavior. In dynamically typed languages,
if we tried to call a method on a type that the type didn’t implement, we’d get
an error at runtime. Rust moves these errors to compile time so that we’re
forced to fix the problems before our code is even able to run. Additionally,
we don’t have to write code that checks for behavior at runtime since we’ve
already checked at compile time, which improves performance compared to other
languages without having to give up the flexibility of generics.</p>
<p>There’s another kind of generics that we’ve been using without even realizing
it called <em>lifetimes</em>. Rather than helping us ensure that a type has the
behavior we need it to have, lifetimes help us ensure that references are valid
as long as we need them to be. Let’s learn how lifetimes do that.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#validating-references-with-lifetimes" id="validating-references-with-lifetimes"><h2>Validating References with Lifetimes</h2></a>
<p>When we talked about references in Chapter 4, we left out an important detail:
every reference in Rust has a <em>lifetime</em>, which is the scope for which that
reference is valid. Most of the time lifetimes are implicit and inferred, just
like most of the time types are inferred. Similarly to when we have to annotate
types because multiple types are possible, there are cases where the lifetimes
of references could be related in a few different ways, so Rust needs us to
annotate the relationships using generic lifetime parameters so that it can
make sure the actual references used at runtime will definitely be valid.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s a bit unusual, and will be different to tools you’ve used in other
programming languages. Lifetimes are, in some ways, Rust’s most distinctive
feature.</p>
<p>Lifetimes are a big topic that can’t be covered in entirety in this chapter, so
we’ll cover common ways you might encounter lifetime syntax in this chapter to
get you familiar with the concepts. Chapter 19 will contain more advanced
information about everything lifetimes can do.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#lifetimes-prevent-dangling-references" id="lifetimes-prevent-dangling-references"><h3>Lifetimes Prevent Dangling References</h3></a>
<p>The main aim of lifetimes is to prevent dangling references, which will cause a
program to reference data other than the data we’re intending to reference.
Consider the program in Listing 10-18, with an outer scope and an inner scope.
The outer scope declares a variable named <code>r</code> with no initial value, and the
inner scope declares a variable named <code>x</code> with the initial value of 5. Inside
the inner scope, we attempt to set the value of <code>r</code> as a reference to <code>x</code>. Then
the inner scope ends, and we attempt to print out the value in <code>r</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">{
    let r;

    {
        let x = 5;
        r = &amp;x;
    }

    println!(&quot;r: {}&quot;, r);
}

has gone out of scope</span></p>
<blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#uninitialized-variables-cannot-be-used" id="uninitialized-variables-cannot-be-used"><h4>Uninitialized Variables Cannot Be Used</h4></a>
<p>The next few examples declare variables without giving them an initial value,
so that the variable name exists in the outer scope. This might appear to be
in conflict with Rust not having null. However, if we try to use a variable
before giving it a value, we’ll get a compile-time error. Try it out!</p>

<p>When we compile this code, we’ll get an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error: `x` does not live long enough

   |              - borrow occurs here

   |     ^ `x` dropped here while still borrowed
...
10 | }
   | - borrowed value needs to live until here
</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>x</code> doesn’t “live long enough.” Why not? Well, <code>x</code> is going to go
out of scope when we hit the closing curly bracket on line 7, ending the inner
scope. But <code>r</code> is valid for the outer scope; its scope is larger and we say
that it “lives longer.” If Rust allowed this code to work, <code>r</code> would be
referencing memory that was deallocated when <code>x</code> went out of scope, and
anything we tried to do with <code>r</code> wouldn’t work correctly. So how does Rust
determine that this code should not be allowed?</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-borrow-checker" id="the-borrow-checker"><h4>The Borrow Checker</h4></a>
<p>The part of the compiler called the <em>borrow checker</em> compares scopes to
determine that all borrows are valid. Listing 10-19 shows the same example from
Listing 10-18 with annotations showing the lifetimes of the variables:</p>

<p>We’ve annotated the lifetime of <code>r</code> with <code>'a</code> and the lifetime of <code>x</code> with
<code>'b</code>. As you can see, the inner <code>'b</code> block is much smaller than the outer <code>'a</code>
lifetime block. At compile time, Rust compares the size of the two lifetimes
and sees that <code>r</code> has a lifetime of <code>'a</code>, but that it refers to an object with
a lifetime of <code>'b</code>. The program is rejected because the lifetime <code>'b</code> is
shorter than the lifetime of <code>'a</code>: the subject of the reference does not live
as long as the reference.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example in Listing 10-20 that doesn’t try to make a dangling
reference and compiles without any errors:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">

<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-20: A valid reference because the data has a
longer lifetime than the reference</span></p>
<p>Here, <code>x</code> has the lifetime <code>'b</code>, which in this case is larger than <code>'a</code>. This
means <code>r</code> can reference <code>x</code>: Rust knows that the reference in <code>r</code> will always
be valid while <code>x</code> is valid.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve shown where the lifetimes of references are in a concrete
example and discussed how Rust analyzes lifetimes to ensure references will
always be valid, let’s talk about generic lifetimes of parameters and return
values in the context of functions.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#generic-lifetimes-in-functions" id="generic-lifetimes-in-functions"><h3>Generic Lifetimes in Functions</h3></a>
<p>Let’s write a function that will return the longest of two string slices. We
want to be able to call this function by passing it two string slices, and we
want to get back a string slice. The code in Listing 10-21 should print <code>The longest string is abcd</code> once we’ve implemented the <code>longest</code> function:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

<p>Note that we want the function to take string slices (which are references, as
we talked about in Chapter 4) since we don’t want the <code>longest</code> function to
take ownership of its arguments. We want the function to be able to accept
slices of a <code>String</code> (which is the type of the variable <code>string1</code>) as well as
string literals (which is what variable <code>string2</code> contains).</p>
<!-- why is `a` a slice and `b` a literal? You mean "a" from the string "abcd"? -->
<!-- I've changed the variable names to remove ambiguity between the variable
name `a` and the "a" from the string "abcd". `string1` is not a slice, it's a
`String`, but we're going to pass a slice that refers to that `String` to the
`longest` function (`string1.as_str()` creates a slice that references the
`String` stored in `string1`). We chose to have `string2` be a literal since
the reader might have code with both `String`s and string literals, and the way
most readers first get into problems with lifetimes is involving string slices,
so we wanted to demonstrate the flexibility of taking string slices as
arguments but the issues you might run into because string slices are
references.
All of the `String`/string slice/string literal concepts here are covered
thoroughly in Chapter 4, which is why we put two back references here (above
and below). If these topics are confusing you in this context, I'd be
interested to know if rereading Chapter 4 clears up that confusion.

<p>If we try to implement the <code>longest</code> function as shown in Listing 10-22, it
won’t compile:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-22: An implementation of the <code>longest</code>

   |
   = help: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but the
   signature does not say whether it is borrowed from `x` or `y`
</code></pre>
<p>The help text is telling us that the return type needs a generic lifetime
parameter on it because Rust can’t tell if the reference being returned refers
to <code>x</code> or <code>y</code>. Actually, we don’t know either, since the <code>if</code> block in the body
of this function returns a reference to <code>x</code> and the <code>else</code> block returns a
reference to <code>y</code>!</p>
<p>As we’re defining this function, we don’t know the concrete values that will be
passed into this function, so we don’t know whether the <code>if</code> case or the <code>else</code>
case will execute. We also don’t know the concrete lifetimes of the references
that will be passed in, so we can’t look at the scopes like we did in Listings
10-19 and 10-20 in order to determine that the reference we return will always
be valid. The borrow checker can’t determine this either, because it doesn’t
know how the lifetimes of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> relate to the lifetime of the return
value. We’re going to add generic lifetime parameters that will define the
relationship between the references so that the borrow checker can perform its
analysis.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#lifetime-annotation-syntax" id="lifetime-annotation-syntax"><h3>Lifetime Annotation Syntax</h3></a>
<p>Lifetime annotations don’t change how long any of the references involved live.
In the same way that functions can accept any type when the signature specifies
a generic type parameter, functions can accept references with any lifetime
when the signature specifies a generic lifetime parameter. What lifetime
annotations do is relate the lifetimes of multiple references to each other.</p>
<p>Lifetime annotations have a slightly unusual syntax: the names of lifetime
parameters must start with an apostrophe <code>'</code>. The names of lifetime parameters
are usually all lowercase, and like generic types, their names are usually very
short. <code>'a</code> is the name most people use as a default. Lifetime parameter
annotations go after the <code>&amp;</code> of a reference, and a space separates the lifetime
annotation from the reference’s type.</p>
<p>Here’s some examples: we’ve got a reference to an <code>i32</code> without a lifetime
parameter, a reference to an <code>i32</code> that has a lifetime parameter named <code>'a</code>,
and a mutable reference to an <code>i32</code> that also has the lifetime <code>'a</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">&amp;i32        // a reference
&amp;'a i32     // a reference with an explicit lifetime
&amp;'a mut i32 // a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime
</code></pre>
<p>One lifetime annotation by itself doesn’t have much meaning: lifetime
annotations tell Rust how the generic lifetime parameters of multiple
references relate to each other. If we have a function with the parameter
<code>first</code> that is a reference to an <code>i32</code> that has the lifetime <code>'a</code>, and the
function has another parameter named <code>second</code> that is another reference to an
<code>i32</code> that also has the lifetime <code>'a</code>, these two lifetime annotations that have
the same name indicate that the references <code>first</code> and <code>second</code> must both live
as long as the same generic lifetime.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#lifetime-annotations-in-function-signatures" id="lifetime-annotations-in-function-signatures"><h3>Lifetime Annotations in Function Signatures</h3></a>
<p>Let’s look at lifetime annotations in the context of the <code>longest</code> function
we’re working on. Just like generic type parameters, generic lifetime
parameters need to be declared within angle brackets between the function name
and the parameter list. The constraint we want to tell Rust about for the
references in the parameters and the return value is that they all must have
the same lifetime, which we’ll name <code>'a</code> and add to each reference as shown in
Listing 10-23:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn longest&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a str, y: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {
    if x.len() &gt; y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-23: The <code>longest</code> function definition that
specifies all the references in the signature must have the same lifetime,
<code>'a</code></span></p>
<p>This will compile and will produce the result we want when used with the <code>main</code>
function in Listing 10-21.</p>
<p>The function signature now says that for some lifetime <code>'a</code>, the function will
get two parameters, both of which are string slices that live at least as long
as the lifetime <code>'a</code>. The function will return a string slice that also will
last at least as long as the lifetime <code>'a</code>. This is the contract we are telling
Rust we want it to enforce.</p>
<p>By specifying the lifetime parameters in this function signature, we are not
changing the lifetimes of any values passed in or returned, but we are saying
that any values that do not adhere to this contract should be rejected by the
borrow checker. This function does not know (or need to know) exactly how long
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> will live, but only needs to know that there is some scope that
can be substituted for <code>'a</code> that will satisfy this signature.</p>
<p>When annotating lifetimes in functions, the annotations go on the function
signature, and not in any of the code in the function body. This is because
Rust is able to analyze the code within the function without any help, but when
a function has references to or from code outside that function, the lifetimes
of the arguments or return values will potentially be different each time the
function is called. This would be incredibly costly and often impossible for
Rust to figure out. In this case, we need to annotate the lifetimes ourselves.</p>
<p>When concrete references are passed to <code>longest</code>, the concrete lifetime that
gets substituted for <code>'a</code> is the part of the scope of <code>x</code> that overlaps with
the scope of <code>y</code>. Since scopes always nest, another way to say this is that the
generic lifetime <code>'a</code> will get the concrete lifetime equal to the smaller of
the lifetimes of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. Because we’ve annotated the returned reference
with the same lifetime parameter <code>'a</code>, the returned reference will therefore be
guaranteed to be valid as long as the shorter of the lifetimes of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s see how this restricts the usage of the <code>longest</code> function by passing in
references that have different concrete lifetimes. Listing 10-24 is a
straightforward example that should match your intuition from any language:
<code>string1</code> is valid until the end of the outer scope, <code>string2</code> is valid until
the end of the inner scope, and <code>result</code> references something that is valid
until the end of the inner scope. The borrow checker approves of this code; it
will compile and print <code>The longest string is long string is long</code> when run:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># fn longest&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a str, y: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {

#     } else {

    let string1 = String::from(&quot;long string is long&quot;);

    {
        let string2 = String::from(&quot;xyz&quot;);
        let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
        println!(&quot;The longest string is {}&quot;, result);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-24: Using the <code>longest</code> function with
references to <code>String</code> values that have different concrete lifetimes</span></p>
<p>Next, let’s try an example that will show that the lifetime of the reference in
<code>result</code> must be the smaller lifetime of the two arguments. We’ll move the
declaration of the <code>result</code> variable outside the inner scope, but leave the
assignment of the value to the <code>result</code> variable inside the scope with
<code>string2</code>. Next, we’ll move the <code>println!</code> that uses <code>result</code> outside of the
inner scope, after it has ended. The code in Listing 10-25 will not compile:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from(&quot;long string is long&quot;);
    let result;
    {
        let string2 = String::from(&quot;xyz&quot;);
        result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
    }
    println!(&quot;The longest string is {}&quot;, result);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-25: Attempting to use <code>result</code> after <code>string2</code>

   | - borrowed value needs to live until here
</code></pre>
<p>The error is saying that in order for <code>result</code> to be valid for the <code>println!</code>,
<code>string2</code> would need to be valid until the end of the outer scope. Rust knows
this because we annotated the lifetimes of the function parameters and return
values with the same lifetime parameter, <code>'a</code>.</p>
<p>We can look at this code as humans and see that <code>string1</code> is longer, and
therefore <code>result</code> will contain a reference to <code>string1</code>. Because <code>string1</code> has
not gone out of scope yet, a reference to <code>string1</code> will still be valid for the
<code>println!</code>. However, what we’ve told Rust with the lifetime parameters is that
the lifetime of the reference returned by the <code>longest</code> function is the same as
the smaller of the lifetimes of the references passed in. Therefore, the borrow
checker disallows the code in Listing 10-25 as possibly having an invalid
reference.</p>
<p>Try designing some more experiments that vary the values and lifetimes of the
references passed in to the <code>longest</code> function and how the returned reference
is used. Make hypotheses about whether your experiments will pass the borrow
checker or not before you compile, then check to see if you’re right!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#thinking-in-terms-of-lifetimes" id="thinking-in-terms-of-lifetimes"><h3>Thinking in Terms of Lifetimes</h3></a>
<p>The exact way to specify lifetime parameters depends on what your function is
doing. For example, if we changed the implementation of the <code>longest</code> function
to always return the first argument rather than the longest string slice, we
wouldn’t need to specify a lifetime on the <code>y</code> parameter. This code compiles:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn longest&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a str, y: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {
    x
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, we’ve specified a lifetime parameter <code>'a</code> for the parameter
<code>x</code> and the return type, but not for the parameter <code>y</code>, since the lifetime of
<code>y</code> does not have any relationship with the lifetime of <code>x</code> or the return value.</p>
<p>When returning a reference from a function, the lifetime parameter for the
return type needs to match the lifetime parameter of one of the arguments. If
the reference returned does <em>not</em> refer to one of the arguments, the only other
possibility is that it refers to a value created within this function, which
would be a dangling reference since the value will go out of scope at the end
of the function. Consider this attempted implementation of the <code>longest</code>
function that won’t compile:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn longest&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;str, y: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {
    let result = String::from(&quot;really long string&quot;);
    result.as_str()
}
</code></pre>
<p>Even though we’ve specified a lifetime parameter <code>'a</code> for the return type, this
implementation fails to compile because the return value lifetime is not
related to the lifetime of the parameters at all. Here’s the error message we
get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error: `result` does not live long enough
  |
3 |     result.as_str()
  |     ^^^^^^ does not live long enough
4 | }
  | - borrowed value only lives until here
  |
note: borrowed value must be valid for the lifetime 'a as defined on the block
at 1:44...
  |
1 | fn longest&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;str, y: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {
  |                                             ^
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that <code>result</code> will go out of scope and get cleaned up at the end
of the <code>longest</code> function, and we’re trying to return a reference to <code>result</code>
from the function. There’s no way we can specify lifetime parameters that would
change the dangling reference, and Rust won’t let us create a dangling
reference. In this case, the best fix would be to return an owned data type
rather than a reference so that the calling function is then responsible for
cleaning up the value.</p>
<p>Ultimately, lifetime syntax is about connecting the lifetimes of various
arguments and return values of functions. Once they’re connected, Rust has
enough information to allow memory-safe operations and disallow operations that
would create dangling pointers or otherwise violate memory safety.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#lifetime-annotations-in-struct-definitions" id="lifetime-annotations-in-struct-definitions"><h3>Lifetime Annotations in Struct Definitions</h3></a>
<p>Up until now, we’ve only defined structs to hold owned types. It is possible
for structs to hold references, but we need to add a lifetime annotation on
every reference in the struct’s definition. Listing 10-26 has a struct named
<code>ImportantExcerpt</code> that holds a string slice:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">struct ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {
    part: &amp;'a str,
}

fn main() {
    let novel = String::from(&quot;Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...&quot;);
    let first_sentence = novel.split('.')
        .next()
        .expect(&quot;Could not find a '.'&quot;);
    let i = ImportantExcerpt { part: first_sentence };
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-26: A struct that holds a reference, so its
definition needs a lifetime annotation</span></p>
<p>This struct has one field, <code>part</code>, that holds a string slice, which is a
reference. Just like with generic data types, we have to declare the name of
the generic lifetime parameter inside angle brackets after the name of the
struct so that we can use the lifetime parameter in the body of the struct
definition.</p>
<p>The <code>main</code> function here creates an instance of the <code>ImportantExcerpt</code> struct
that holds a reference to the first sentence of the <code>String</code> owned by the
variable <code>novel</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#lifetime-elision" id="lifetime-elision"><h3>Lifetime Elision</h3></a>
<p>In this section, we’ve learned that every reference has a lifetime, and we need
to specify lifetime parameters for functions or structs that use references.
However, in Chapter 4 we had a function in the “String Slices” section, shown
again in Listing 10-27, that compiled without lifetime annotations:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn first_word(s: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &amp;item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &amp;s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &amp;s[..]
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-27: A function we defined in Chapter 4 that
compiled without lifetime annotations, even though the parameter and return
type are references</span></p>
<p>The reason this function compiles without lifetime annotations is historical:
in early versions of pre-1.0 Rust, this indeed wouldn’t have compiled. Every
reference needed an explicit lifetime. At that time, the function signature
would have been written like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word&lt;'a&gt;(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {
</code></pre>
<p>After writing a lot of Rust code, the Rust team found that Rust programmers
were typing the same lifetime annotations over and over in particular
situations. These situations were predictable and followed a few deterministic
patterns. The Rust team then programmed these patterns into the Rust compiler’s
code so that the borrow checker can infer the lifetimes in these situations
without forcing the programmer to explicitly add the annotations.</p>
<p>We mention this piece of Rust history because it’s entirely possible that more
deterministic patterns will emerge and be added to the compiler. In the future,
even fewer lifetime annotations might be required.</p>
<p>The patterns programmed into Rust’s analysis of references are called the
<em>lifetime elision rules</em>. These aren’t rules for programmers to follow; the
rules are a set of particular cases that the compiler will consider, and if
your code fits these cases, you don’t need to write the lifetimes explicitly.</p>
<p>The elision rules don’t provide full inference: if Rust deterministically
applies the rules but there’s still ambiguity as to what lifetimes the
references have, it won’t guess what the lifetime of the remaining references
should be. In this case, the compiler will give you an error that can be
resolved by adding the lifetime annotations that correspond to your intentions
for how the references relate to each other.</p>
<p>First, some definitions: Lifetimes on function or method parameters are called
<em>input lifetimes</em>, and lifetimes on return values are called <em>output lifetimes</em>.</p>
<p>Now, on to the rules that the compiler uses to figure out what lifetimes
references have when there aren’t explicit annotations. The first rule applies
to input lifetimes, and the second two rules apply to output lifetimes. If the
compiler gets to the end of the three rules and there are still references that
it can’t figure out lifetimes for, the compiler will stop with an error.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each parameter that is a reference gets its own lifetime parameter. In other
words, a function with one parameter gets one lifetime parameter: <code>fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32)</code>, a function with two arguments gets two separate
lifetime parameters: <code>fn foo&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32, y: &amp;'b i32)</code>, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned
to all output lifetime parameters: <code>fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32) -&gt; &amp;'a i32</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is <code>&amp;self</code>
or <code>&amp;mut self</code> because this is a method, then the lifetime of <code>self</code> is
assigned to all output lifetime parameters. This makes writing methods much
nicer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s pretend we’re the compiler and apply these rules to figure out what the
lifetimes of the references in the signature of the <code>first_word</code> function in
Listing 10-27 are. The signature starts without any lifetimes associated with
the references:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word(s: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>Then we (as the compiler) apply the first rule, which says each parameter gets
its own lifetime. We’re going to call it <code>'a</code> as usual, so now the signature is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word&lt;'a&gt;(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>On to the second rule, which applies because there is exactly one input
lifetime. The second rule says the lifetime of the one input parameter gets
assigned to the output lifetime, so now the signature is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word&lt;'a&gt;(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {
</code></pre>
<p>Now all the references in this function signature have lifetimes, and the
compiler can continue its analysis without needing the programmer to annotate
the lifetimes in this function signature.</p>
<p>Let’s do another example, this time with the <code>longest</code> function that had no
lifetime parameters when we started working with in Listing 10-22:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn longest(x: &amp;str, y: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>Pretending we’re the compiler again, let’s apply the first rule: each parameter
gets its own lifetime. This time we have two parameters, so we have two
lifetimes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn longest&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a str, y: &amp;'b str) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>Looking at the second rule, it doesn’t apply since there is more than one input
lifetime. Looking at the third rule, this also does not apply because this is a
function rather than a method, so none of the parameters are <code>self</code>. So we’re
out of rules, but we haven’t figured out what the return type’s lifetime is.
This is why we got an error trying to compile the code from Listing 10-22: the
compiler worked through the lifetime elision rules it knows, but still can’t
figure out all the lifetimes of the references in the signature.</p>
<p>Because the third rule only really applies in method signatures, let’s look at
lifetimes in that context now, and see why the third rule means we don’t have
to annotate lifetimes in method signatures very often.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#lifetime-annotations-in-method-definitions" id="lifetime-annotations-in-method-definitions"><h3>Lifetime Annotations in Method Definitions</h3></a>
<!-- Is this different to the reference lifetime annotations, or just a
finalized explanation? -->
<!-- This is about lifetimes on references in method signatures, which is where
the 3rd lifetime elision rule kicks in. It can also be confusing where lifetime
parameters need to be declared and used since the lifetime parameters could go
with the struct's fields or with references passed into or returned from
methods. /Carol -->
<p>When we implement methods on a struct with lifetimes, the syntax is again the
same as that of generic type parameters that we showed in Listing 10-11: the
place that lifetime parameters are declared and used depends on whether the
lifetime parameter is related to the struct fields or the method arguments and
return values.</p>
<p>Lifetime names for struct fields always need to be declared after the <code>impl</code>
keyword and then used after the struct’s name, since those lifetimes are part
of the struct’s type.</p>
<p>In method signatures inside the <code>impl</code> block, references might be tied to the
lifetime of references in the struct’s fields, or they might be independent. In
addition, the lifetime elision rules often make it so that lifetime annotations
aren’t necessary in method signatures. Let’s look at some examples using the
struct named <code>ImportantExcerpt</code> that we defined in Listing 10-26.</p>
<p>First, here’s a method named <code>level</code>. The only parameter is a reference to
<code>self</code>, and the return value is just an <code>i32</code>, not a reference to anything:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# struct ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {
#     part: &amp;'a str,
# }
#
impl&lt;'a&gt; ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {
    fn level(&amp;self) -&gt; i32 {
        3
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The lifetime parameter declaration after <code>impl</code> and use after the type name is
required, but we’re not required to annotate the lifetime of the reference to
<code>self</code> because of the first elision rule.</p>
<p>Here’s an example where the third lifetime elision rule applies:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# struct ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {
#     part: &amp;'a str,
# }
#
impl&lt;'a&gt; ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {
    fn announce_and_return_part(&amp;self, announcement: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {
        println!(&quot;Attention please: {}&quot;, announcement);
        self.part
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>There are two input lifetimes, so Rust applies the first lifetime elision rule
and gives both <code>&amp;self</code> and <code>announcement</code> their own lifetimes. Then, because
one of the parameters is <code>&amp;self</code>, the return type gets the lifetime of <code>&amp;self</code>,
and all lifetimes have been accounted for.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-static-lifetime" id="the-static-lifetime"><h3>The Static Lifetime</h3></a>
<p>There is <em>one</em> special lifetime we need to discuss: <code>'static</code>. The <code>'static</code>
lifetime is the entire duration of the program. All string literals have the
<code>'static</code> lifetime, which we can choose to annotate as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let s: &amp;'static str = &quot;I have a static lifetime.&quot;;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The text of this string is stored directly in the binary of your program and
the binary of your program is always available. Therefore, the lifetime of all
string literals is <code>'static</code>.</p>
<!-- How would you add a static lifetime (below)? -->
<!-- Just like you'd specify any lifetime, see above where it shows `&'static str`. /Carol -->
<p>You may see suggestions to use the <code>'static</code> lifetime in error message help
text, but before specifying <code>'static</code> as the lifetime for a reference, think
about whether the reference you have is one that actually lives the entire
lifetime of your program or not (or even if you want it to live that long, if
it could). Most of the time, the problem in the code is an attempt to create a
dangling reference or a mismatch of the available lifetimes, and the solution
is fixing those problems, not specifying the <code>'static</code> lifetime.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#generic-type-parameters-trait-bounds-and-lifetimes-together" id="generic-type-parameters-trait-bounds-and-lifetimes-together"><h3>Generic Type Parameters, Trait Bounds, and Lifetimes Together</h3></a>
<p>Let’s briefly look at the syntax of specifying generic type parameters, trait
bounds, and lifetimes all in one function!</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::fmt::Display;

fn longest_with_an_announcement&lt;'a, T&gt;(x: &amp;'a str, y: &amp;'a str, ann: T) -&gt; &amp;'a str
    where T: Display
{
    println!(&quot;Announcement! {}&quot;, ann);
    if x.len() &gt; y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This is the <code>longest</code> function from Listing 10-23 that returns the longest of
two string slices, but with an extra argument named <code>ann</code>. The type of <code>ann</code> is
the generic type <code>T</code>, which may be filled in by any type that implements the
<code>Display</code> trait as specified by the <code>where</code> clause. This extra argument will be
printed out before the function compares the lengths of the string slices,
which is why the <code>Display</code> trait bound is necessary. Because lifetimes are a
type of generic, the declarations of both the lifetime parameter <code>'a</code> and the
generic type parameter <code>T</code> go in the same list within the angle brackets after
the function name.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#summary-8" id="summary-8"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>We covered a lot in this chapter! Now that you know about generic type
parameters, traits and trait bounds, and generic lifetime parameters, you’re
ready to write code that isn’t duplicated but can be used in many different
situations. Generic type parameters mean the code can be applied to different
types. Traits and trait bounds ensure that even though the types are generic,
those types will have the behavior the code needs. Relationships between the
lifetimes of references specified by lifetime annotations ensure that this
flexible code won’t have any dangling references. And all of this happens at
compile time so that run-time performance isn’t affected!</p>
<p>Believe it or not, there’s even more to learn in these areas: Chapter 17 will
discuss trait objects, which are another way to use traits. Chapter 19 will be
covering more complex scenarios involving lifetime annotations. Chapter 20 will
get to some advanced type system features. Up next, though, let’s talk about
how to write tests in Rust so that we can make sure our code using all these
features is working the way we want it to!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#writing-automated-tests" id="writing-automated-tests"><h1>Writing Automated Tests</h1></a>
<p>In his 1972 essay, “The Humble Programmer,” Edsger W. Dijkstra said that
“Program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but
it is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.” That doesn’t mean we
shouldn’t try to test as much as we can! Correctness in our programs is the
extent to which our code does what we intend it to do. Rust is a programming
language designed with a high degree of concern about the correctness of
programs, but correctness is complex and not easy to prove. Rust’s type system
shoulders a huge part of this burden, but the type system cannot catch every
kind of incorrectness. As such, Rust includes support for writing automated
software tests within the language.</p>
<p>As an example, say we write a function called <code>add_two</code> that adds two to
whatever number is passed to it. This function’s signature accepts an integer
as a parameter and returns an integer as a result. When we implement and
compile that function, Rust does all the type checking and borrow checking that
you’ve learned so far to ensure that, for instance, we aren’t passing a
<code>String</code> value or an invalid reference to this function. But Rust <em>can’t</em> check
that this function will do precisely what we intend, which is return the
parameter plus two rather than, say, the parameter plus 10 or the parameter
minus 50! That’s where tests come in.</p>
<p>We can write tests that assert, for example, that when we pass <code>3</code> to the
<code>add_two</code> function, the returned value is <code>5</code>. We can run these tests whenever
we make changes to our code to make sure any existing correct behavior has not
changed.</p>
<p>Testing is a complex skill: although we can’t cover every detail about how to
write good tests in one chapter, we’ll discuss the mechanics of Rust’s testing
facilities. We’ll talk about the annotations and macros available to you when
writing your tests, the default behavior and options provided for running your
tests, and how to organize tests into unit tests and integration tests.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#how-to-write-tests" id="how-to-write-tests"><h2>How to Write Tests</h2></a>
<p>Tests are Rust functions that verify that the non-test code is functioning in
the expected manner. The bodies of test functions typically perform these three
actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up any needed data or state</li>
<li>Run the code we want to test</li>
<li>Assert the results are what we expect</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s look at the features Rust provides specifically for writing tests that
take these actions, which include the <code>test</code> attribute, a few macros, and the
<code>should_panic</code> attribute.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-anatomy-of-a-test-function" id="the-anatomy-of-a-test-function"><h3>The Anatomy of a Test Function</h3></a>
<p>At its simplest, a test in Rust is a function that’s annotated with the <code>test</code>
attribute. Attributes are metadata about pieces of Rust code; one example is
the <code>derive</code> attribute we used with structs in Chapter 5. To change a function
into a test function, we add <code>#[test]</code> on the line before <code>fn</code>. When we run our
tests with the <code>cargo test</code> command, Rust builds a test runner binary that runs
the functions annotated with the <code>test</code> attribute and reports on whether each
test function passes or fails.</p>
<p>In Chapter 7, we saw that when we make a new library project with Cargo, a test
module with a test function in it is automatically generated for us. This
module helps us start writing our tests so we don’t have to look up the exact
structure and syntax of test functions every time we start a new project. We
can add as many additional test functions and as many test modules as we want!</p>
<p>We’ll explore some aspects of how tests work by experimenting with the template
test generated for us without actually testing any code. Then we’ll write some
real-world tests that call some code that we’ve written and assert that its
behavior is correct.</p>
<p>Let’s create a new library project called <code>adder</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo new adder
     Created library `adder` project
$ cd adder
</code></pre>
<p>The contents of the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file in your adder library should look like
Listing 11-1:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-1: The test module and function generated
automatically by <code>cargo new</code></span></p>
<p>For now, let’s ignore the top two lines and focus on the function to see how it
works. Note the <code>#[test]</code> annotation before the <code>fn</code> line: this attribute
indicates this is a test function, so the test runner knows to treat this
function as a test. We could also have non-test functions in the <code>tests</code> module
to help set up common scenarios or perform common operations, so we need to
indicate which functions are tests by using the <code>#[test]</code> attribute.</p>
<p>The function body uses the <code>assert_eq!</code> macro to assert that 2 + 2 equals 4.
This assertion serves as an example of the format for a typical test. Let’s run
it to see that this test passes.</p>
<p>The <code>cargo test</code> command runs all tests in our project, as shown in Listing
11-2:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.22 secs
     Running target/debug/deps/adder-ce99bcc2479f4607

test tests::it_works ... ok

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-2: The output from running the automatically
generated test</span></p>
<p>Cargo compiled and ran the test. After the <code>Compiling</code>, <code>Finished</code>, and
<code>Running</code> lines is the line <code>running 1 test</code>. The next line shows the name
of the generated test function, called <code>it_works</code>, and the result of running
that test, <code>ok</code>. The overall summary of running the tests appears next. The
text <code>test result: ok.</code> means that all the tests passed, and the portion that
reads <code>1 passed; 0 failed</code> totals the number of tests that passed or failed.</p>
<p>Because we don’t have any tests we’ve marked as ignored, the summary shows <code>0 ignored</code>. We also haven’t filtered the tests being run, so the end of the
summary shows <code>0 filtered out</code>. We’ll talk about ignoring and filtering out
tests in the next section, “Controlling How Tests Are Run.”</p>
<p>The <code>0 measured</code> statistic is for benchmark tests that measure performance.
Benchmark tests are, as of this writing, only available in nightly Rust. See
Chapter 1 for more information about nightly Rust.</p>
<p>The next part of the test output, which starts with <code>Doc-tests adder</code>, is for
the results of any documentation tests. We don’t have any documentation tests
yet, but Rust can compile any code examples that appear in our API
documentation. This feature helps us keep our docs and our code in sync! We’ll
discuss how to write documentation tests in the “Documentation Comments”
section of Chapter 14. For now, we’ll ignore the <code>Doc-tests</code> output.</p>
<p>Let’s change the name of our test to see how that changes the test output.
Change the <code>it_works</code> function to a different name, such as <code>exploration</code>, like
so:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn exploration() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Then run <code>cargo test</code> again. The output now shows <code>exploration</code> instead of
<code>it_works</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">running 1 test
test tests::exploration ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s add another test, but this time we’ll make a test that fails! Tests fail
when something in the test function panics. Each test is run in a new thread,
and when the main thread sees that a test thread has died, the test is marked
as failed. We talked about the simplest way to cause a panic in Chapter 9,
which is to call the <code>panic!</code> macro. Enter the new test, <code>another</code>, so your
<em>src/lib.rs</em> file looks like Listing 11-3:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn exploration() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }

    #[test]
    fn another() {
        panic!(&quot;Make this test fail&quot;);
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-3: Adding a second test that will fail because
we call the <code>panic!</code> macro</span></p>
<p>Run the tests again using <code>cargo test</code>. The output should look like Listing
11-4, which shows that our <code>exploration</code> test passed and <code>another</code> failed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">running 2 tests
test tests::exploration ... ok
test tests::another ... FAILED

failures:

---- tests::another stdout ----
    thread 'tests::another' panicked at 'Make this test fail', src/lib.rs:10:8
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.

failures:
    tests::another

test result: FAILED. 1 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

error: test failed
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-4: Test results when one test passes and one
test fails</span></p>
<p>Instead of <code>ok</code>, the line <code>test tests::another</code> shows <code>FAILED</code>. Two new
sections appear between the individual results and the summary: the first
section displays the detailed reason for each test failure. In this case,
<code>another</code> failed because it <code>panicked at 'Make this test fail'</code>, which happened
on line 10 in the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file. The next section lists just the names of
all the failing tests, which is useful when there are lots of tests and lots of
detailed failing test output. We can use the name of a failing test to run just
that test to more easily debug it; we’ll talk more about ways to run tests in
the “Controlling How Tests Are Run” section.</p>
<p>The summary line displays at the end: overall, our test result is <code>FAILED</code>.
We had one test pass and one test fail.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve seen what the test results look like in different scenarios,
let’s look at some macros other than <code>panic!</code> that are useful in tests.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#checking-results-with-the-assert-macro" id="checking-results-with-the-assert-macro"><h3>Checking Results with the <code>assert!</code> Macro</h3></a>
<p>The <code>assert!</code> macro, provided by the standard library, is useful when you want
to ensure that some condition in a test evaluates to <code>true</code>. We give the
<code>assert!</code> macro an argument that evaluates to a Boolean. If the value is
<code>true</code>, <code>assert!</code> does nothing and the test passes. If the value is <code>false</code>,
the <code>assert!</code> macro calls the <code>panic!</code> macro, which causes the test to fail.
Using the <code>assert!</code> macro helps us check that our code is functioning in the
way we intend.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, Listing 5-15, we used a <code>Rectangle</code> struct and a <code>can_hold</code>
method, which are repeated here in Listing 11-5. Let’s put this code in the
<em>src/lib.rs</em> file and write some tests for it using the <code>assert!</code> macro.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Rectangle {
    length: u32,
    width: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    pub fn can_hold(&amp;self, other: &amp;Rectangle) -&gt; bool {
        self.length &gt; other.length &amp;&amp; self.width &gt; other.width
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-5: Using the <code>Rectangle</code> struct and its
<code>can_hold</code> method from Chapter 5</span></p>
<p>The <code>can_hold</code> method returns a Boolean, which means it’s a perfect use case
for the <code>assert!</code> macro. In Listing 11-6, we write a test that exercises the
<code>can_hold</code> method by creating a <code>Rectangle</code> instance that has a length of 8 and
a width of 7, and asserting that it can hold another <code>Rectangle</code> instance that
has a length of 5 and a width of 1:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {

    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn larger_can_hold_smaller() {
        let larger = Rectangle { length: 8, width: 7 };
        let smaller = Rectangle { length: 5, width: 1 };

        assert!(larger.can_hold(&amp;smaller));
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-6: A test for <code>can_hold</code> that checks that a
larger rectangle can indeed hold a smaller rectangle</span></p>
<p>Note that we’ve added a new line inside the <code>tests</code> module: the <code>use super::*;</code>
line. The <code>tests</code> module is a regular module that follows the usual visibility
rules we covered in Chapter 7 in the “Privacy Rules” section. Because the
<code>tests</code> module is an inner module, we need to bring the code under test in the
outer module into the scope of the inner module. We use a glob here so anything
we define in the outer module is available to this <code>tests</code> module.</p>
<p>We’ve named our test <code>larger_can_hold_smaller</code>, and we’ve created the two
<code>Rectangle</code> instances that we need. Then we called the <code>assert!</code> macro and
passed it the result of calling <code>larger.can_hold(&amp;smaller)</code>. This expression
is supposed to return <code>true</code>, so our test should pass. Let’s find out!</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">running 1 test
test tests::larger_can_hold_smaller ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre>
<p>It does pass! Let’s add another test, this time asserting that a smaller
rectangle cannot hold a larger rectangle:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[cfg(test)]

    #[test]
    fn larger_can_hold_smaller() {
        // --snip--
    }

    #[test]
    fn smaller_cannot_hold_larger() {
        let larger = Rectangle { length: 8, width: 7 };
        let smaller = Rectangle { length: 5, width: 1 };

        assert!(!smaller.can_hold(&amp;larger));
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Because the correct result of the <code>can_hold</code> function in this case is <code>false</code>,
we need to negate that result before we pass it to the <code>assert!</code> macro. As a
result, our test will pass if <code>can_hold</code> returns <code>false</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">running 2 tests
test tests::smaller_cannot_hold_larger ... ok
test tests::larger_can_hold_smaller ... ok

test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre>
<p>Two tests that pass! Now let’s see what happens to our test results when we
introduce a bug in our code. Let’s change the implementation of the <code>can_hold</code>
method by replacing the greater-than sign with a less-than sign when it
compares the lengths:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]

    pub fn can_hold(&amp;self, other: &amp;Rectangle) -&gt; bool {
        self.length &lt; other.length &amp;&amp; self.width &gt; other.width
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Running the tests now produces the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">running 2 tests

<p>Our tests caught the bug! Because <code>larger.length</code> is 8 and <code>smaller.length</code> is
5, the comparison of the lengths in <code>can_hold</code> now returns <code>false</code>: 8 is not
less than 5.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#testing-equality-with-the-assert_eq-and-assert_ne-macros" id="testing-equality-with-the-assert_eq-and-assert_ne-macros"><h3>Testing Equality with the <code>assert_eq!</code> and <code>assert_ne!</code> Macros</h3></a>
<p>A common way to test functionality is to compare the result of the code under
test to the value we expect the code to return to make sure they’re equal. We
could do this using the <code>assert!</code> macro and passing it an expression using the
<code>==</code> operator. However, this is such a common test that the standard library
provides a pair of macros—<code>assert_eq!</code> and <code>assert_ne!</code>—to perform this test
more conveniently. These macros compare two arguments for equality or
inequality, respectively. They’ll also print the two values if the assertion
fails, which makes it easier to see <em>why</em> the test failed; conversely, the
<code>assert!</code> macro only indicates that it got a <code>false</code> value for the <code>==</code>
expression, not the values that lead to the <code>false</code> value.</p>
<p>In Listing 11-7, we write a function named <code>add_two</code> that adds <code>2</code> to its
parameter and returns the result. Then we test this function using the
<code>assert_eq!</code> macro.</p>

instead add <code>3</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre>
<p>Our test caught the bug! The <code>it_adds_two</code> test failed, displaying the message
<code>assertion failed: `(left == right)`</code> and showing that <code>left</code> was <code>4</code> and
<code>right</code> was <code>5</code>. This message is useful and helps us start debugging: it means
the <code>left</code> argument to <code>assert_eq!</code> was <code>4</code>, but the <code>right</code> argument, where we
had <code>add_two(2)</code>, was <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>Note that in some languages and test frameworks, the parameters to the
functions that assert two values are equal are called <code>expected</code> and <code>actual</code>,
and the order in which we specify the arguments matters. However, in Rust,
they’re called <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>, and the order in which we specify the value
we expect and the value that the code under test produces doesn’t matter. We
could write the assertion in this test as <code>assert_eq!(add_two(2), 4)</code>, which
would result in a failure message that displays <code>assertion failed: `(left == right)`</code> and that <code>left</code> was <code>5</code> and <code>right</code> was <code>4</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>assert_ne!</code> macro will pass if the two values we give it are not equal and
fail if they’re equal. This macro is most useful for cases when we’re not sure
what a value <em>will</em> be, but we know what the value definitely <em>won’t</em> be if our
code is functioning as we intend. For example, if we’re testing a function that
is guaranteed to change its input in some way, but the way in which the input
is changed depends on the day of the week that we run our tests, the best thing
to assert might be that the output of the function is not equal to the input.</p>
<p>Under the surface, the <code>assert_eq!</code> and <code>assert_ne!</code> macros use the operators
<code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>, respectively. When the assertions fail, these macros print their
arguments using debug formatting, which means the values being compared must
implement the <code>PartialEq</code> and <code>Debug</code> traits. All the primitive types and most
of the standard library types implement these traits. For structs and enums
that you define, you’ll need to implement <code>PartialEq</code> to assert that values of
those types are equal or not equal. You’ll need to implement <code>Debug</code> to print
out the values when the assertion fails. Because both traits are derivable
traits, as mentioned in Listing 5-12 in Chapter 5, this is usually as
straightforward as adding the <code>#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]</code> annotation to your
struct or enum definition. See Appendix C for more details about these and
other derivable traits.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#adding-custom-failure-messages" id="adding-custom-failure-messages"><h3>Adding Custom Failure Messages</h3></a>
<p>We can also add a custom message to be printed with the failure message as
optional arguments to the <code>assert!</code>, <code>assert_eq!</code>, and <code>assert_ne!</code> macros. Any
arguments specified after the one required argument to <code>assert!</code> or the two
required arguments to <code>assert_eq!</code> and <code>assert_ne!</code> are passed along to the
<code>format!</code> macro (discussed in Chapter 8 in the “Concatenation with the <code>+</code>
Operator or the <code>format!</code> Macro” section), so you can pass a format string that
contains <code>{}</code> placeholders and values to go in those placeholders. Custom
messages are useful to document what an assertion means; when a test fails,
we’ll have a better idea of what the problem is with the code.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we have a function that greets people by name, and we
want to test that the name we pass into the function appears in the output:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub fn greeting(name: &amp;str) -&gt; String {
    format!(&quot;Hello {}!&quot;, name)
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn greeting_contains_name() {
        let result = greeting(&quot;Carol&quot;);
        assert!(result.contains(&quot;Carol&quot;));
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The requirements for this program haven’t been agreed upon yet, and we’re
pretty sure the <code>Hello</code> text at the beginning of the greeting will change. We
decided we don’t want to have to update the test for the name when that
happens, so instead of checking for exact equality to the value returned from
the <code>greeting</code> function, we’ll just assert that the output contains the text of
the input parameter.</p>
<p>Let’s introduce a bug into this code by changing <code>greeting</code> to not include
<code>name</code> to see what this test failure looks like:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub fn greeting(name: &amp;str) -&gt; String {
    String::from(&quot;Hello!&quot;)
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Running this test produces the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">running 1 test
test tests::greeting_contains_name ... FAILED

failures:

---- tests::greeting_contains_name stdout ----
        thread 'tests::greeting_contains_name' panicked at 'assertion failed:
result.contains(&quot;Carol&quot;)', src/lib.rs:12:8
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.

failures:
    tests::greeting_contains_name
</code></pre>
<p>This result just indicates that the assertion failed and which line the
assertion is on. A more useful failure message in this case would print the
value we got from the <code>greeting</code> function. Let’s change the test function,
giving it a custom failure message made from a format string with a placeholder
filled in with the actual value we got from the <code>greeting</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[test]
fn greeting_contains_name() {
    let result = greeting(&quot;Carol&quot;);
    assert!(
        result.contains(&quot;Carol&quot;),
        &quot;Greeting did not contain name, value was `{}`&quot;, result
    );
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now when we run the test, we’ll get a more informative error message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">---- tests::greeting_contains_name stdout ----
        thread 'tests::greeting_contains_name' panicked at 'Greeting did not
contain name, value was `Hello!`', src/lib.rs:12:8
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
</code></pre>
<p>We can see the value we actually got in the test output, which would help us
debug what happened instead of what we were expecting to happen.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#checking-for-panics-with-should_panic" id="checking-for-panics-with-should_panic"><h3>Checking for Panics with <code>should_panic</code></h3></a>
<p>In addition to checking that our code returns the correct values we expect,
it’s also important to check that our code handles error conditions as we
expect. For example, consider the <code>Guess</code> type that we created in Chapter 9,
Listing 9-9. Other code that uses <code>Guess</code> depends on the guarantee that <code>Guess</code>
instances will only contain values between 1 and 100. We can write a test that
ensures that attempting to create a <code>Guess</code> instance with a value outside that
range panics.</p>
<p>We do this by adding another attribute, <code>should_panic</code>, to our test function.
This attribute makes a test pass if the code inside the function panics; the
test will fail if the code inside the function doesn’t panic.</p>
<p>Listing 11-8 shows a test that checks that the error conditions of <code>Guess::new</code>
happen when we expect:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]

pub struct Guess {
    value: u32,
}

impl Guess {
    pub fn new(value: u32) -&gt; Guess {
        if value &lt; 1 || value &gt; 100 {
            panic!(&quot;Guess value must be between 1 and 100, got {}.&quot;, value);
        }

        Guess {
            value
        }
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    #[should_panic]
    fn greater_than_100() {
        Guess::new(200);
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-8: Testing that a condition will cause a
<code>panic!</code></span></p>
<p>We place the <code>#[should_panic]</code> attribute after the <code>#[test]</code> attribute and
before the test function it applies to. Let’s look at the result when this test
passes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">running 1 test
test tests::greater_than_100 ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre>
<p>Looks good! Now let’s introduce a bug in our code by removing the condition
that the <code>new</code> function will panic if the value is greater than 100:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# pub struct Guess {
#     value: u32,
# }
#
// --snip--

impl Guess {
    pub fn new(value: u32) -&gt; Guess {
        if value &lt; 1  {
            panic!(&quot;Guess value must be between 1 and 100, got {}.&quot;, value);
        }

        Guess {
            value
        }
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>When we run the test in Listing 11-8, it will fail:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">running 1 test
test tests::greater_than_100 ... FAILED

failures:

failures:
    tests::greater_than_100

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre>
<p>We don’t get a very helpful message in this case, but when we look at the test
function, we see that it’s annotated with <code>#[should_panic]</code>. The failure we got
means that the code in the test function did not cause a panic.</p>
<p>Tests that use <code>should_panic</code> can be imprecise because they only indicate that
the code has caused some panic. A <code>should_panic</code> test would pass even if the
test panics for a different reason than the one we were expecting to happen. To
make <code>should_panic</code> tests more precise, we can add an optional <code>expected</code>
parameter to the <code>should_panic</code> attribute. The test harness will make sure that
the failure message contains the provided text. For example, consider the
modified code for <code>Guess</code> in Listing 11-9 where the <code>new</code> function panics with
different messages depending on whether the value was too small or too large:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]

        if value &lt; 1 {
            panic!(&quot;Guess value must be greater than or equal to 1, got {}.&quot;,
                   value);
        } else if value &gt; 100 {
            panic!(&quot;Guess value must be less than or equal to 100, got {}.&quot;,
                   value);
        }

        Guess {
            value
        }
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]

    fn greater_than_100() {
        Guess::new(200);
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-9: Testing that a condition will cause a
<code>panic!</code> with a particular panic message</span></p>
<p>This test will pass because the value we put in the <code>should_panic</code> attribute’s
<code>expected</code> parameter is a substring of the message that the <code>Guess::new</code>
function panics with. We could have specified the entire panic message that we
expect, which in this case would be <code>Guess value must be less than or equal to 100, got 200.</code> What you choose to specify in the expected parameter for
<code>should_panic</code> depends on how much of the panic message is unique or dynamic
and how precise you want your test to be. In this case, a substring of the
panic message is enough to ensure that the code in the test function executes
the <code>else if value &gt; 100</code> case.</p>
<p>To see what happens when a <code>should_panic</code> test with an <code>expected</code> message
fails, let’s again introduce a bug into our code by swapping the bodies of the
<code>if value &lt; 1</code> and the <code>else if value &gt; 100</code> blocks:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">if value &lt; 1 {
    panic!(&quot;Guess value must be less than or equal to 100, got {}.&quot;, value);
} else if value &gt; 100 {
    panic!(&quot;Guess value must be greater than or equal to 1, got {}.&quot;, value);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This time when we run the <code>should_panic</code> test, it will fail:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">running 1 test

</code></pre>
<p>The failure message indicates that this test did indeed panic as we expected,
but the panic message did not include the expected string <code>'Guess value must be less than or equal to 100'</code>. The panic message that we did get in this case was
<code>Guess value must be greater than or equal to 1, got 200.</code> Now we can start
figuring out where our bug is!</p>
<p>Now that you know several ways to write tests, let’s look at what is happening
when we run our tests and explore the different options we can use with <code>cargo test</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#controlling-how-tests-are-run" id="controlling-how-tests-are-run"><h2>Controlling How Tests Are Run</h2></a>
<p>Just as <code>cargo run</code> compiles your code and then runs the resulting binary,
<code>cargo test</code> compiles your code in test mode and runs the resulting test
binary. You can specify command line options to change the default behavior of
<code>cargo test</code>. For example, the default behavior of the binary produced by
<code>cargo test</code> is to run all the tests in parallel and capture output generated
during test runs, preventing the output from being displayed and making it
easier to read the output related to the test results.</p>
<p>Some command line options go to <code>cargo test</code> and some go to the resulting test
binary. To separate these two types of arguments, you list the arguments that
go to <code>cargo test</code> followed by the separator <code>--</code> and then the arguments that
go to the test binary. Running <code>cargo test --help</code> displays the options you can
use with <code>cargo test</code>, and running <code>cargo test -- --help</code> displays the options
you can use after the separator <code>--</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#running-tests-in-parallel-or-consecutively" id="running-tests-in-parallel-or-consecutively"><h3>Running Tests in Parallel or Consecutively</h3></a>
<p>When you run multiple tests, by default they run in parallel using threads.
This means the tests will finish running faster so you can get feedback quicker
on whether or not your code is working. Because the tests are running at the
same time, make sure your tests don’t depend on each other or on any shared
state, including a shared environment, such as the current working directory or
environment variables.</p>
<p>For example, say each of your tests runs some code that creates a file on disk
named <em>test-output.txt</em> and writes some data to that file. Then each test reads
the data in that file and asserts that the file contains a particular value,
which is different in each test. Because the tests run at the same time, one
test might overwrite the file between when another test writes and reads the
file. The second test will then fail, not because the code is incorrect, but
because the tests have interfered with each other while running in parallel.
One solution is to make sure each test writes to a different file; another
solution is to run the tests one at a time.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to run the tests in parallel or if you want more fine-grained
control over the number of threads used, you can send the <code>--test-threads</code> flag
and the number of threads you want to use to the test binary. Take a look at
the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo test -- --test-threads=1
</code></pre>
<p>We set the number of test threads to <code>1</code>, telling the program not to use any
parallelism. Running the tests using one thread will take longer than running
them in parallel, but the tests won’t interfere with each other if they share
state.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#showing-function-output" id="showing-function-output"><h3>Showing Function Output</h3></a>
<p>By default, if a test passes, Rust’s test library captures anything printed to
standard output. For example, if we call <code>println!</code> in a test and the test
passes, we won’t see the <code>println!</code> output in the terminal: we’ll only see the
line that indicates the test passed. If a test fails, we’ll see whatever was
printed to standard output with the rest of the failure message.</p>
<p>As an example, Listing 11-10 has a silly function that prints the value of its
parameter and returns 10, as well as a test that passes and a test that fails.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>

<p>Sometimes, running a full test suite can take a long time. If you’re working on

<p>We can specify part of a test name, and any test whose name matches that value

<p>This command ran all tests with <code>add</code> in the name name and filtered out the

<a class="header" href="print.html#ignoring-some-tests-unless-specifically-requested" id="ignoring-some-tests-unless-specifically-requested"><h3>Ignoring Some Tests Unless Specifically Requested</h3></a>
<p>Sometimes a few specific tests can be very time-consuming to execute, so you
might want to exclude them during most runs of <code>cargo test</code>. Rather than
listing as arguments all tests you do want to run, you can instead annotate the
time-consuming tests using the <code>ignore</code> attribute to exclude them, as shown
here:</p>

<p>After <code>#[test]</code> we add the <code>#[ignore]</code> line to the test we want to exclude. Now
when we run our tests, <code>it_works</code> runs, but <code>expensive_test</code> doesn’t:</p>

<p>The <code>expensive_test</code> function is listed as <code>ignored</code>. If we want to run only
the ignored tests, we can use <code>cargo test -- --ignored</code>:</p>

<p>By controlling which tests run, you can make sure your <code>cargo test</code> results
will be fast. When you’re at a point where it makes sense to check the results
of the <code>ignored</code> tests and you have time to wait for the results, you can run
<code>cargo test -- --ignored</code> instead.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#test-organization" id="test-organization"><h2>Test Organization</h2></a>
<p>As mentioned at the start of the chapter, testing is a complex discipline, and
different people use different terminology and organization. The Rust community
thinks about tests in terms of two main categories: <em>unit tests</em> and
<em>integration tests</em>. Unit tests are small and more focused, testing one module
in isolation at a time, and can test private interfaces. Integration tests are
entirely external to your library and use your code in the same way any other
external code would, using only the public interface and potentially exercising
multiple modules per test.</p>
<p>Writing both kinds of tests is important to ensure that the pieces of your
library are doing what you expect them to separately and together.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#unit-tests" id="unit-tests"><h3>Unit Tests</h3></a>
<p>The purpose of unit tests is to test each unit of code in isolation from the
rest of the code to quickly pinpoint where code is and isn’t working as
expected. We put unit tests in the <em>src</em> directory in each file with the code
that they’re testing. The convention is that we create a module named <code>tests</code>
in each file to contain the test functions, and we annotate the module with
<code>cfg(test)</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-tests-module-and-cfgtest" id="the-tests-module-and-cfgtest"><h4>The Tests Module and <code>#[cfg(test)]</code></h4></a>
<p>The <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> annotation on the tests module tells Rust to compile and run
the test code only when we run <code>cargo test</code>, but not when we run <code>cargo build</code>.
This saves compile time when we only want to build the library and saves space
in the resulting compiled artifact because the tests are not included. You’ll
see that because integration tests go in a different directory, they don’t need
the <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> annotation. However, because unit tests go in the same files
as the code, we use <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> to specify that they shouldn’t be included
in the compiled result.</p>
<p>Recall that when we generated the new <code>adder</code> project in the first section of
this chapter, Cargo generated this code for us:</p>

<p>This code is the automatically generated test module. The attribute <code>cfg</code>
stands for <em>configuration</em> and tells Rust that the following item should only
be included given a certain configuration option. In this case, the
configuration option is <code>test</code>, which is provided by Rust for compiling and
running tests. By using the <code>cfg</code> attribute, Cargo compiles our test code only
if we actively run the tests with <code>cargo test</code>. This includes any helper
functions that might be within this module, in addition to the functions
annotated with <code>#[test]</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#testing-private-functions" id="testing-private-functions"><h4>Testing Private Functions</h4></a>
<p>There’s debate within the testing community about whether or not private
functions should be tested directly, and other languages make it difficult or
impossible to test private functions. Regardless of which testing ideology you
adhere to, Rust’s privacy rules do allow you to test private functions.
Consider the code in Listing 11-12 with the private function <code>internal_adder</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub fn add_two(a: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    internal_adder(a, 2)
}

fn internal_adder(a: i32, b: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    a + b
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn internal() {
        assert_eq!(4, internal_adder(2, 2));
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-12: Testing a private function</span></p>
<p>Note that the <code>internal_adder</code> function is not marked as <code>pub</code>, but because
tests are just Rust code and the <code>tests</code> module is just another module, we can
import and call <code>internal_adder</code> in a test just fine. If you don’t think
private functions should be tested, there’s nothing in Rust that will compel
you to do so.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#integration-tests" id="integration-tests"><h3>Integration Tests</h3></a>
<p>In Rust, integration tests are entirely external to your library. They use your
library in the same way any other code would, which means they can only call
functions that are part of your library’s public API. Their purpose is to test
that many parts of your library work together correctly. Units of code that
work correctly on their own could have problems when integrated, so test
coverage of the integrated code is important as well. To create integration
tests, you first need a <em>tests</em> directory.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-tests-directory" id="the-tests-directory"><h4>The <em>tests</em> Directory</h4></a>
<p>We create a <em>tests</em> directory at the top level of our project directory, next
to <em>src</em>. Cargo knows to look for integration test files in this directory. We
can then make as many test files as we want to in this directory, and Cargo
will compile each of the files as an individual crate.</p>
<p>Let’s create an integration test. With the code in Listing 11-12 still in the
<em>src/lib.rs</em> file, make a <em>tests</em> directory, create a new file named
<em>tests/integration_test.rs</em>, and enter the code in Listing 11-13:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: tests/integration_test.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate adder;

#[test]
fn it_adds_two() {
    assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-13: An integration test of a function in the
<code>adder</code> crate</span></p>
<p>We’ve added <code>extern crate adder</code> at the top of the code, which we didn’t need
in the unit tests. The reason is that each test in the <code>tests</code> directory is a
separate crate, so we need to import our library into each of them.</p>
<p>We don’t need to annotate any code in <em>tests/integration_test.rs</em> with
<code>#[cfg(test)]</code>. Cargo treats the <code>tests</code> directory specially and compiles files
in this directory only when we run <code>cargo test</code>. Run <code>cargo test</code> now:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo test

</code></pre>
<p>The three sections of output include the unit tests, the integration test, and
the doc tests. The first section for the unit tests is the same as we’ve been
seeing: one line for each unit test (one named <code>internal</code> that we added in
Listing 11-12) and then a summary line for the unit tests.</p>
<p>The integration tests section starts with the line <code>Running target/debug/deps/integration-test-ce99bcc2479f4607</code> (the hash at the end of
your output will be different). Next, there is a line for each test function in
that integration test and a summary line for the results of the integration
test just before the <code>Doc-tests adder</code> section starts.</p>
<p>Recall that adding more unit test functions in any <em>src</em> file adds more test
result lines to the unit tests section. Adding more test functions to the
integration test file we created adds more lines to that file’s section. Each
integration test file has its own section, so if we add more files in the
<em>tests</em> directory, there will be more integration test sections.</p>
<p>We can still run a particular integration test function by specifying the test
function’s name as an argument to <code>cargo test</code>. To run all the tests in a
particular integration test file, use the <code>--test</code> argument of <code>cargo test</code>
followed by the name of the file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo test --test integration_test

<p>This command runs only the tests in the <em>tests/integration_test.rs</em> file.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#submodules-in-integration-tests" id="submodules-in-integration-tests"><h4>Submodules in Integration Tests</h4></a>
<p>As you add more integration tests, you might want to make more than one file in
the <em>tests</em> directory to help organize them; for example, you can group the
test functions by the functionality they’re testing. As mentioned earlier, each
file in the <em>tests</em> directory is compiled as its own separate crate.</p>
<p>Treating each integration test file as its own crate is useful to create
separate scopes that are more like the way end users will be using your crate.
However, this means files in the <em>tests</em> directory don’t share the same
behavior as files in <em>src</em> do, which you learned in Chapter 7 regarding how to
separate code into modules and files.</p>
<p>The different behavior of files in the <em>tests</em> directory is most noticeable
when you have a set of helper functions that would be useful in multiple
integration test files and you try to follow the steps in the “Moving Modules
to Other Files” section of Chapter 7 to extract them into a common module. For
example, if we create <em>tests/common.rs</em> and place a function named <code>setup</code> in
it, we can add some code to <code>setup</code> that we want to call from multiple test
functions in multiple test files:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: tests/common.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub fn setup() {
    // setup code specific to your library's tests would go here
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>When we run the tests again, we’ll see a new section in the test output for the
<em>common.rs</em> file, even though this file doesn’t contain any test functions, nor
did we call the <code>setup</code> function from anywhere:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">running 1 test
test tests::internal ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

     Running target/debug/deps/common-b8b07b6f1be2db70

running 0 tests

     Running target/debug/deps/integration_test-d993c68b431d39df

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre>
<p>Having <code>common</code> appear in the test results with <code>running 0 tests</code> displayed for
it is not what we wanted. We just wanted to share some code with the other
integration test files.</p>
<p>To avoid having <code>common</code> appear in the test output, instead of creating
<em>tests/common.rs</em>, we’ll create <em>tests/common/mod.rs</em>. In the “Rules of Module
Filesystems” section of Chapter 7, we used the naming convention
<em>module_name/mod.rs</em> for files of modules that have submodules, and we don’t
have submodules for <code>common</code> here, but naming the file this way tells Rust not
to treat the <code>common</code> module as an integration test file. When we move the
<code>setup</code> function code into <em>tests/common/mod.rs</em> and delete the
<em>tests/common.rs</em> file, the section in the test output will no longer appear.
Files in subdirectories of the <em>tests</em> directory don’t get compiled as separate
crates or have sections in the test output.</p>
<p>After we’ve created <em>tests/common/mod.rs</em>, we can use it from any of the
integration test files as a module. Here’s an example of calling the <code>setup</code>
function from the <code>it_adds_two</code> test in <em>tests/integration_test.rs</em>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: tests/integration_test.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate adder;

mod common;

#[test]
fn it_adds_two() {
    common::setup();
    assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>mod common;</code> declaration is the same as the module declarations
we demonstrated in Listing 7-4. Then in the test function, we can call the
<code>common::setup()</code> function.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#integration-tests-for-binary-crates" id="integration-tests-for-binary-crates"><h4>Integration Tests for Binary Crates</h4></a>
<p>If our project is a binary crate that only contains a <em>src/main.rs</em> file and
doesn’t have a <em>src/lib.rs</em> file, we can’t create integration tests in the
<em>tests</em> directory and use <code>extern crate</code> to import functions defined in the
<em>src/main.rs</em> file. Only library crates expose functions that other crates can
call and use; binary crates are meant to be run on their own.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons Rust projects that provide a binary have a
straightforward <em>src/main.rs</em> file that calls logic that lives in the
<em>src/lib.rs</em> file. Using that structure, integration tests <em>can</em> test the
library crate by using <code>extern crate</code> to exercise the important functionality.
If the important functionality works, the small amount of code in the
<em>src/main.rs</em> file will work as well, and that small amount of code doesn’t
need to be tested.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#summary-9" id="summary-9"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>Rust’s testing features provide a way to specify how code should function to
ensure it continues to work as we expect even as we make changes. Unit tests
exercise different parts of a library separately and can test private
implementation details. Integration tests check that many parts of the library
work together correctly, and they use the library’s public API to test the code
in the same way external code will use it. Even though Rust’s type system and
ownership rules help prevent some kinds of bugs, tests are still important to
help reduce logic bugs having to do with how your code is expected to behave.</p>
<p>Let’s combine the knowledge you learned in this chapter and in previous
chapters and work on a project in the next chapter!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#an-io-project-building-a-command-line-program" id="an-io-project-building-a-command-line-program"><h1>An I/O Project: Building a Command Line Program</h1></a>
<p>This chapter is a recap of the many skills you’ve learned so far and an
exploration of a few more standard library features. We’ll build a command line
tool that interacts with file and command line input/output to practice some of
the Rust concepts you now have under your belt.</p>
<p>Rust’s speed, safety, <em>single binary</em> output, and cross-platform support make
it an ideal language for creating command line tools, so for our project, we’ll
make our own version of the classic command line tool <code>grep</code> (<strong>g</strong>lobally
search a <strong>r</strong>egular <strong>e</strong>xpression and <strong>p</strong>rint). In the simplest use case,
<code>grep</code> searches a specified file for a specified string. To do so, <code>grep</code> takes
as its arguments a filename and a string, and then reads the file and finds
lines in that file that contain the string argument. It then prints those lines.</p>
<p>Along the way, we’ll show how to make our command line tool use features of the
terminal that many command line tools use. We’ll read the value of an
environment variable to allow the user to configure the behavior of our tool.
We’ll also print to the standard error console stream (<code>stderr</code>) instead of
standard output (<code>stdout</code>), so, for example, the user can redirect successful
output to a file while still seeing error messages onscreen.</p>
<p>One Rust community member, Andrew Gallant, has already created a fully
featured, very fast version of <code>grep</code>, called <code>ripgrep</code>. By comparison, our
version of <code>grep</code> will be fairly simple, but this chapter will give you some of
the background knowledge you need to understand a real-world project like
<code>ripgrep</code>.</p>
<p>Our <code>grep</code> project will combine a number of concepts you’ve learned so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizing code (using what you learned in modules, Chapter 7)</li>
<li>Using vectors and strings (collections, Chapter 8)</li>
<li>Handling errors (Chapter 9)</li>
<li>Using traits and lifetimes where appropriate (Chapter 10)</li>
<li>Writing tests (Chapter 11)</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll also briefly introduce closures, iterators, and trait objects, which
Chapters 13 and 17 will cover in detail.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#accepting-command-line-arguments" id="accepting-command-line-arguments"><h2>Accepting Command Line Arguments</h2></a>
<p>Let’s create a new project with, as always, <code>cargo new</code>. We’ll call our project
<code>minigrep</code> to distinguish it from the <code>grep</code> tool that you might already have
on your system.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo new --bin minigrep
     Created binary (application) `minigrep` project
$ cd minigrep
</code></pre>
<p>The first task is to make <code>minigrep</code> accept its two command line arguments: the
filename and a string to search for. That is, we want to be able to run our
program with <code>cargo run</code>, a string to search for, and a path to a file to
search in, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run searchstring example-filename.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Right now, the program generated by <code>cargo new</code> cannot process arguments we
give it. However, some existing libraries on <a href="https://crates.io/">Crates.io</a>
can help us with writing a program that accepts command line arguments, but
because you’re just learning this concept, let’s implement this capability
ourselves.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#reading-the-argument-values" id="reading-the-argument-values"><h3>Reading the Argument Values</h3></a>
<p>To make sure <code>minigrep</code> is able to read the values of command line arguments we
pass to it, we’ll need a function provided in Rust’s standard library, which is
<code>std::env::args</code>. This function returns an <em>iterator</em> of the command line
arguments that were given to <code>minigrep</code>. We haven’t discussed iterators yet
(we’ll cover them fully in Chapter 13), but for now you only need to know two
details about iterators: iterators produce a series of values, and we can call
the <code>collect</code> function on an iterator to turn it into a collection, such as a
vector, containing all the elements the iterator produces.</p>
<p>Use the code in Listing 12-1 to allow your <code>minigrep</code> program to read any
command line arguments passed to it and then collect the values into a vector:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();
    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, args);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-1: Collecting the command line arguments into
a vector and printing them</span></p>
<p>First, we bring the <code>std::env</code> module into scope with a <code>use</code> statement so we
can use its <code>args</code> function. Notice that the <code>std::env::args</code> function is
nested in two levels of modules. As we discussed in Chapter 7, in cases where
the desired function is nested in more than one module, it’s conventional to
bring the parent module into scope rather than the function. As a result, we
can easily use other functions from <code>std::env</code>. It’s also less ambiguous than
adding <code>use std::env::args</code> and then calling the function with just <code>args</code>
because <code>args</code> might easily be mistaken for a function that’s defined in the
current module.</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-args-function-and-invalid-unicode" id="the-args-function-and-invalid-unicode"><h3>The <code>args</code> Function and Invalid Unicode</h3></a>
<p>Note that <code>std::env::args</code> will panic if any argument contains invalid
Unicode. If your program needs to accept arguments containing invalid
Unicode, use <code>std::env::args_os</code> instead. That function returns <code>OsString</code>
values instead of <code>String</code> values. We’ve chosen to use <code>std::env::args</code> here
for simplicity because <code>OsString</code> values differ per platform and are more
complex to work with than <code>String</code> values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the first line of <code>main</code>, we call <code>env::args</code>, and immediately use <code>collect</code>
to turn the iterator into a vector containing all the values produced by the
iterator. We can use the <code>collect</code> function to create many kinds of
collections, so we explicitly annotate the type of <code>args</code> to specify that we
want a vector of strings. Although we very rarely need to annotate types in
Rust, <code>collect</code> is one function you do often need to annotate because Rust
isn’t able to infer the kind of collection you want.</p>
<p>Finally, we print the vector using the debug formatter, <code>:?</code>. Let’s try running
the code with no arguments, and then with two arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
--snip--
[&quot;target/debug/minigrep&quot;]

$ cargo run needle haystack
--snip--
[&quot;target/debug/minigrep&quot;, &quot;needle&quot;, &quot;haystack&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the first value in the vector is <code>&quot;target/debug/minigrep&quot;</code>, which
is the name of our binary. This matches the behavior of the arguments list in
C, letting programs use the name by which they were invoked in their execution.
It’s often convenient to have access to the program name in case we want to
print it in messages or change behavior of the program based on what command
line alias was used to invoke the program. But for the purposes of this
chapter, we’ll ignore it and save only the two arguments we need.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#saving-the-argument-values-in-variables" id="saving-the-argument-values-in-variables"><h3>Saving the Argument Values in Variables</h3></a>
<p>Printing the value of the vector of arguments illustrated that the program is
able to access the values specified as command line arguments. Now we need to
save the values of the two arguments in variables so we can use the values
throughout the rest of the program. We do that in Listing 12-2:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust should_panic">use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();

    let query = &amp;args[1];
    let filename = &amp;args[2];

    println!(&quot;Searching for {}&quot;, query);
    println!(&quot;In file {}&quot;, filename);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-2: Creating variables to hold the query
argument and filename argument</span></p>
<p>As we saw when we printed the vector, the program’s name takes up the first
value in the vector at <code>args[0]</code>, so we’re starting at index <code>1</code>. The first
argument <code>minigrep</code> takes is the string we’re searching for, so we put a
reference to the first argument in the variable <code>query</code>. The second argument
will be the filename, so we put a reference to the second argument in the
variable <code>filename</code>.</p>
<p>We temporarily print the values of these variables to prove that the code is
working as we intend. Let’s run this program again with the arguments <code>test</code>
and <code>sample.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run test sample.txt

</code></pre>
<p>Great, the program is working! The values of the arguments we need are being
saved into the right variables. Later we’ll add some error handling to deal
with certain potential erroneous situations, such as when the user provides no
arguments; for now, we’ll ignore that situation and work on adding file reading
capabilities instead.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#reading-a-file" id="reading-a-file"><h2>Reading a File</h2></a>
<p>Now we’ll add functionality to read the file that is specified in the
<code>filename</code> command line argument. First, we need a sample file to test it with:
the best kind of file to use to make sure <code>minigrep</code> is working is one with a
small amount of text over multiple lines with some repeated words. Listing 12-3
has an Emily Dickinson poem that will work well! Create a file called
<em>poem.txt</em> at the root level of your project, and enter the poem “I’m Nobody!
Who are you?”</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: poem.txt</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-text">I’m nobody! Who are you?

</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-3: A poem by Emily Dickinson will make a good
test case.</span></p>
<p>With the text in place, edit <em>src/main.rs</em> and add code to open the file, as
shown in Listing 12-4:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust should_panic">use std::env;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::prelude::*;

#     let filename = &amp;args[2];
#
#     println!(&quot;Searching for {}&quot;, query);
    // --snip--
    println!(&quot;In file {}&quot;, filename);

    let mut f = File::open(filename).expect(&quot;file not found&quot;);

    let mut contents = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&amp;mut contents)
        .expect(&quot;something went wrong reading the file&quot;);

    println!(&quot;With text:\n{}&quot;, contents);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-4: Reading the contents of the file specified
by the second argument</span></p>
<p>First, we add some more <code>use</code> statements to bring in relevant parts of the
standard library: we need <code>std::fs::File</code> to handle files, and
<code>std::io::prelude::*</code> contains various useful traits for doing I/O, including
file I/O. In the same way that Rust has a general prelude that brings certain
types and functions into scope automatically, the <code>std::io</code> module has its own
prelude of common types and functions you’ll need when working with I/O. Unlike
the default prelude, we must explicitly add a <code>use</code> statement for the prelude
from <code>std::io</code>.</p>
<p>In <code>main</code>, we’ve added three statements: first, we get a mutable handle to the
file by calling the <code>File::open</code> function and passing it the value of the
<code>filename</code> variable. Second, we create a variable called <code>contents</code> and set it
to a mutable, empty <code>String</code>. This will hold the content of the file after we
read it in. Third, we call <code>read_to_string</code> on our file handle and pass a
mutable reference to <code>contents</code> as an argument.</p>
<p>After those lines, we’ve again added a temporary <code>println!</code> statement that
prints the value of <code>contents</code> after the file is read, so we can check that the
program is working so far.</p>
<p>Let’s run this code with any string as the first command line argument (because
we haven’t implemented the searching part yet) and the <em>poem.txt</em> file as the
second argument:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Great! The code read and then printed the content of the file. But the code has
a few flaws. The <code>main</code> function has multiple responsibilities: generally,
functions are clearer and easier to maintain if each function is responsible
for only one idea. The other problem is that we’re not handling errors as well
as we could be. The program is still small so these flaws aren’t a big problem,
but as the program grows, it will be harder to fix them cleanly. It’s good
practice to begin refactoring early on when developing a program, because it’s
much easier to refactor smaller amounts of code. We’ll do that next.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#refactoring-to-improve-modularity-and-error-handling" id="refactoring-to-improve-modularity-and-error-handling"><h2>Refactoring to Improve Modularity and Error Handling</h2></a>
<p>To improve our program, we’ll fix four problems that have to do with the
program’s structure and how it’s handling potential errors.</p>
<p>First, our <code>main</code> function now performs two tasks: it parses arguments and
opens files. For such a small function, this isn’t a major problem. However, if
we continue to grow our program inside <code>main</code>, the number of separate tasks the
<code>main</code> function handles will increase. As a function gains responsibilities, it
becomes more difficult to reason about, harder to test, and harder to change
without breaking one of its parts. It’s best to separate functionality so each
function is responsible for one task.</p>
<p>This issue also ties into the second problem: although <code>query</code> and <code>filename</code>
are configuration variables to our program, variables like <code>f</code> and <code>contents</code>
are used to perform the program’s logic. The longer <code>main</code> becomes, the more
variables we’ll need to bring into scope; the more variables we have in scope,
the harder it will be to keep track of the purpose of each. It’s best to group
the configuration variables into one structure to make their purpose clear.</p>
<p>The third problem is that we’ve used <code>expect</code> to print an error message when
opening the file fails, but the error message just prints <code>file not found</code>.
Opening a file can fail in a number of ways besides the file being missing: for
example, the file might exist, but we might not have permission to open it.
Right now, if we’re in that situation, we’d print the <code>file not found</code> error
message that would give the user the wrong information!</p>
<p>Fourth, we use <code>expect</code> repeatedly to handle different errors, and if the user
runs our program without specifying enough arguments, they’ll get an <code>index out of bounds</code> error from Rust that doesn’t clearly explain the problem. It would
be best if all the error handling code was in one place so future maintainers
have only one place to consult in the code if the error handling logic needs to
change. Having all the error handling code in one place will also ensure that
we’re printing messages that will be meaningful to our end users.</p>
<p>Let’s address these four problems by refactoring our project.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#separation-of-concerns-for-binary-projects" id="separation-of-concerns-for-binary-projects"><h3>Separation of Concerns for Binary Projects</h3></a>
<p>The organizational problem of allocating responsibility for multiple tasks to
the <code>main</code> function is common to many binary projects. As a result, the Rust
community has developed a type of guideline process for splitting the separate
concerns of a binary program when <code>main</code> starts getting large. The process has
the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Split your program into a <em>main.rs</em> and a <em>lib.rs</em>, and move your program’s
logic to <em>lib.rs</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in <em>main.rs</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract it
from <em>main.rs</em> and move it to <em>lib.rs</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The responsibilities that remain in the <code>main</code> function after this process
should be limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values</li>
<li>Setting up any other configuration</li>
<li>Calling a <code>run</code> function in <em>lib.rs</em></li>
<li>Handling the error if <code>run</code> returns an error</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This pattern is about separating concerns: <em>main.rs</em> handles running the
program, and <em>lib.rs</em> handles all the logic of the task at hand. Because we
can’t test the <code>main</code> function directly, this structure lets us test all of our
program’s logic by moving it into functions in <em>lib.rs</em>. The only code that
remains in <em>main.rs</em> will be small enough to verify its correctness by reading
it. Let’s rework our program by following this process.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#extracting-the-argument-parser" id="extracting-the-argument-parser"><h4>Extracting the Argument Parser</h4></a>
<p>We’ll extract the functionality for parsing arguments into a function that
<code>main</code> will call to prepare for moving the command line parsing logic to
<em>src/lib.rs</em>. Listing 12-5 shows the new start of <code>main</code> that calls a new
function <code>parse_config</code>, which we’ll define in <em>src/main.rs</em> for the moment.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();

    let (query, filename) = parse_config(&amp;args);

    // --snip--
}

fn parse_config(args: &amp;[String]) -&gt; (&amp;str, &amp;str) {
    let query = &amp;args[1];
    let filename = &amp;args[2];

    (query, filename)
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-5: Extracting a <code>parse_config</code> function from
<code>main</code></span></p>
<p>We’re still collecting the command line arguments into a vector, but instead of
assigning the argument value at index <code>1</code> to the variable <code>query</code> and the
argument value at index <code>2</code> to the variable <code>filename</code> within the <code>main</code>
function, we pass the whole vector to the <code>parse_config</code> function. The
<code>parse_config</code> function then holds the logic that determines which argument
goes in which variable and passes the values back to <code>main</code>. We still create
the <code>query</code> and <code>filename</code> variables in <code>main</code>, but <code>main</code> no longer has the
responsibility of determining how the command line arguments and variables
correspond.</p>
<p>This rework may seem like overkill for our small program, but we’re refactoring
in small, incremental steps. After making this change, run the program again to
verify that the argument parsing still works. It’s good to check your progress
often, because that will help you identify the cause of problems when they
occur.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#grouping-configuration-values" id="grouping-configuration-values"><h4>Grouping Configuration Values</h4></a>
<p>We can take another small step to improve the <code>parse_config</code> function further.
At the moment, we’re returning a tuple, but then we immediately break that
tuple into individual parts again. This is a sign that perhaps we don’t have
the right abstraction yet.</p>
<p>Another indicator that shows there’s room for improvement is the <code>config</code> part
of <code>parse_config</code>, which implies that the two values we return are related and
are both part of one configuration value. We’re not currently conveying this
meaning in the structure of the data other than grouping the two values into a
tuple: we could put the two values into one struct and give each of the struct
fields a meaningful name. Doing so will make it easier for future maintainers
of this code to understand how the different values relate to each other and
what their purpose is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Some people call this anti-pattern of using primitive values when a
complex type would be more appropriate <em>primitive obsession</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Listing12-6 shows the addition of a struct named <code>Config</code> defined to have
fields named <code>query</code> and <code>filename</code>. We’ve also changed the <code>parse_config</code>
function to return an instance of the <code>Config</code> struct and updated <code>main</code> to use
the struct fields rather than having separate variables:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust should_panic"># use std::env;
# use std::fs::File;
#
fn main() {
    let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();

    let config = parse_config(&amp;args);

    println!(&quot;Searching for {}&quot;, config.query);
    println!(&quot;In file {}&quot;, config.filename);

    let mut f = File::open(config.filename).expect(&quot;file not found&quot;);

    let query = args[1].clone();
    let filename = args[2].clone();

    Config { query, filename }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-6: Refactoring <code>parse_config</code> to return an
instance of a <code>Config</code> struct</span></p>
<p>The signature of <code>parse_config</code> now indicates that it returns a <code>Config</code> value.
In the body of <code>parse_config</code>, where we used to return string slices that
reference <code>String</code> values in <code>args</code>, we now define <code>Config</code> to contain owned
<code>String</code> values. The <code>args</code> variable in <code>main</code> is the owner of the argument
values and is only letting the <code>parse_config</code> function borrow them, which means
we’d violate Rust’s borrowing rules if <code>Config</code> tried to take ownership of the
values in <code>args</code>.</p>
<p>We could manage the <code>String</code> data in a number of different ways, but the
easiest, though somewhat inefficient, route is to call the <code>clone</code> method on
the values. This will make a full copy of the data for the <code>Config</code> instance to
own, which takes more time and memory than storing a reference to the string
data. However, cloning the data also makes our code very straightforward
because we don’t have to manage the lifetimes of the references; in this
circumstance, giving up a little performance to gain simplicity is a worthwhile
trade-off.</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-trade-offs-of-using-clone" id="the-trade-offs-of-using-clone"><h3>The Trade-Offs of Using <code>clone</code></h3></a>
<p>There’s a tendency among many Rustaceans to avoid using <code>clone</code> to fix
ownership problems because of its runtime cost. In Chapter 13, you’ll learn
how to use more efficient methods in this type of situation. But for now,
it’s okay to copy a few strings to continue making progress because we’ll
make these copies only once, and our filename and query string are very
small. It’s better to have a working program that’s a bit inefficient than to
try to hyperoptimize code on your first pass. As you become more experienced
with Rust, it’ll be easier to start with the desirable solution, but for now,
it’s perfectly acceptable to call <code>clone</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve updated <code>main</code> so it places the instance of <code>Config</code> returned by
<code>parse_config</code> into a variable named <code>config</code>, and we updated the code that
previously used the separate <code>query</code> and <code>filename</code> variables so it now uses
the fields on the <code>Config</code> struct instead.</p>
<p>Now our code more clearly conveys that <code>query</code> and <code>filename</code> are related, and
their purpose is to configure how the program will work. Any code that uses
these values knows to find them in the <code>config</code> instance in the fields named
for their purpose.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-a-constructor-for-config" id="creating-a-constructor-for-config"><h4>Creating a Constructor for <code>Config</code></h4></a>
<p>So far, we’ve extracted the logic responsible for parsing the command line
arguments from <code>main</code> and placed it in the <code>parse_config</code> function, which
helped us to see that the <code>query</code> and <code>filename</code> values were related and that
relationship should be conveyed in our code. We then added a <code>Config</code> struct to
name the related purpose of <code>query</code> and <code>filename</code>, and to be able to return
the values’ names as struct field names from the <code>parse_config</code> function.</p>
<p>So now that the purpose of the <code>parse_config</code> function is to create a <code>Config</code>
instance, we can change <code>parse_config</code> from being a plain function to a
function named <code>new</code> that is associated with the <code>Config</code> struct. Making this
change will make the code more idiomatic: we can create instances of types in
the standard library, such as <code>String</code>, by calling <code>String::new</code>, and by
changing <code>parse_config</code> into a <code>new</code> function associated with <code>Config</code>, we’ll
be able to create instances of <code>Config</code> by calling <code>Config::new</code>. Listing 12-7
shows the changes we need to make:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

        let filename = args[2].clone();

    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-7: Changing <code>parse_config</code> into

<p>We’ve updated <code>main</code> where we were calling <code>parse_config</code> to instead call
<code>Config::new</code>. We’ve changed the name of <code>parse_config</code> to <code>new</code> and moved it
within an <code>impl</code> block, which associates the <code>new</code> function with <code>Config</code>. Try
compiling this code again to make sure it works.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#fixing-the-error-handling" id="fixing-the-error-handling"><h3>Fixing the Error Handling</h3></a>
<p>Now we’ll work on fixing our error handling. Recall that attempting to access
the values in the <code>args</code> vector at index <code>1</code> or index <code>2</code> will cause the
program to panic if the vector contains fewer than three items. Try running the
program without any arguments; it will look like this:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The line <code>index out of bounds: the len is 1 but the index is 1</code> is an error
message intended for programmers. It won’t help our end users understand what
happened and what they should do instead. Let’s fix that now.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#improving-the-error-message" id="improving-the-error-message"><h4>Improving the Error Message</h4></a>
<p>In Listing 12-8, we add a check in the <code>new</code> function that will verify that the
slice is long enough before accessing index <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>. If the slice isn’t
long enough, the program panics and displays a better error message than the
<code>index out of bounds</code> message:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// --snip--
fn new(args: &amp;[String]) -&gt; Config {

    }
    // --snip--
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-8: Adding a check for the number of
arguments</span></p>
<p>This code is similar to the <code>Guess::new</code> function we wrote in Listing 9-9 where
we called <code>panic!</code> when the <code>value</code> argument was out of the range of valid
values. Instead of checking for a range of values here, we’re checking that the
length of <code>args</code> is at least <code>3</code> and the rest of the function can operate under
the assumption that this condition has been met. If <code>args</code> has fewer than three
items, this condition will be true, and we call the <code>panic!</code> macro to end the
program immediately.</p>
<p>With these extra few lines of code in <code>new</code>, let’s run the program without any
arguments again to see what the error looks like now:</p>

note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
</code></pre>
<p>This output is better: we now have a reasonable error message. However, we also
have extraneous information we don’t want to give to our users. Perhaps using
the technique we used in Listing 9-9 isn’t the best to use here: a call to
<code>panic!</code> is more appropriate for a programming problem rather than a usage
problem, as discussed in Chapter 9. Instead, we can use the other technique you
learned about in Chapter 9—returning a <code>Result</code> that indicates either success
or an error.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#returning-a-result-from-new-instead-of-calling-panic" id="returning-a-result-from-new-instead-of-calling-panic"><h4>Returning a <code>Result</code> from <code>new</code> Instead of Calling <code>panic!</code></h4></a>
<p>We can instead return a <code>Result</code> value that will contain a <code>Config</code> instance in
the successful case and will describe the problem in the error case. When
<code>Config::new</code> is communicating to <code>main</code>, we can use the <code>Result</code> type to
signal there was a problem. Then we can change <code>main</code> to convert an <code>Err</code>
variant into a more practical error for our users without the surrounding text
about <code>thread 'main'</code> and <code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code> that a call to <code>panic!</code> causes.</p>
<p>Listing 12-9 shows the changes we need to make to the return value of
<code>Config::new</code> and the body of the function needed to return a <code>Result</code>. Note
that this won’t compile until we update <code>main</code> as well, which we’ll do in the
next listing:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl Config {
    fn new(args: &amp;[String]) -&gt; Result&lt;Config, &amp;'static str&gt; {

        }

        let query = args[1].clone();
        let filename = args[2].clone();

    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-9: Returning a <code>Result</code> from
<code>Config::new</code></span></p>
<p>Our <code>new</code> function now returns a <code>Result</code> with a <code>Config</code> instance in the
success case and a <code>&amp;'static str</code> in the error case. Recall from “The Static
Lifetime” section in Chapter 10 that <code>&amp;'static str</code> is the type of string
literals, which is our error message type for now.</p>
<p>We’ve made two changes in the body of the <code>new</code> function: instead of calling
<code>panic!</code> when the user doesn’t pass enough arguments, we now return an <code>Err</code>
value, and we’ve wrapped the <code>Config</code> return value in an <code>Ok</code>. These changes
make the function conform to its new type signature.</p>
<p>Returning an <code>Err</code> value from <code>Config::new</code> allows the <code>main</code> function to
handle the <code>Result</code> value returned from the <code>new</code> function and exit the process
more cleanly in the error case.</p>

<p>To handle the error case and print a user-friendly message, we need to update
<code>main</code> to handle the <code>Result</code> being returned by <code>Config::new</code>, as shown in
Listing 12-10. We’ll also take the responsibility of exiting the command line
tool with a nonzero error code from <code>panic!</code> and implement it by hand. A
nonzero exit status is a convention to signal to the process that called our
program that the program exited with an error state.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-10: Exiting with an error code if creating a

<p>In this listing, we’ve used a method we haven’t covered before:
<code>unwrap_or_else</code>, which is defined on <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> by the standard library.
Using <code>unwrap_or_else</code> allows us to define some custom, non-<code>panic!</code> error
handling. If the <code>Result</code> is an <code>Ok</code> value, this method’s behavior is similar
to <code>unwrap</code>: it returns the inner value <code>Ok</code> is wrapping. However, if the value
is an <code>Err</code> value, this method calls the code in the <em>closure</em>, which is an
anonymous function we define and pass as an argument to <code>unwrap_or_else</code>. We’ll
cover closures in more detail in Chapter 13. For now, you just need to know
that <code>unwrap_or_else</code> will pass the inner value of the <code>Err</code>, which in this
case is the static string <code>not enough arguments</code> that we added in Listing 12-9,
to our closure in the argument <code>err</code> that appears between the vertical pipes.
The code in the closure can then use the <code>err</code> value when it runs.</p>
<p>We’ve added a new <code>use</code> line to import <code>process</code> from the standard library. The
code in the closure that will be run in the error case is only two lines: we
print the <code>err</code> value and then call <code>process::exit</code>. The <code>process::exit</code>
function will stop the program immediately and return the number that was
passed as the exit status code. This is similar to the <code>panic!</code>-based handling
we used in Listing 12-8, but we no longer get all the extra output. Let’s try
it:</p>

<p>Now that we’ve finished refactoring the configuration parsing, let’s turn to
the program’s logic. As we stated in “Separation of Concerns for Binary
Projects” on page XX, we’ll extract a function named <code>run</code> that will hold all
the logic currently in the <code>main</code> function that isn’t involved with setting up
configuration or handling errors. When we’re done, <code>main</code> will be concise and
easy to verify by inspection, and we’ll be able to write tests for all the
other logic.</p>
<p>Listing 12-11 shows the extracted <code>run</code> function. For now, we’re just making
the small, incremental improvement of extracting the function. We’re still
defining the function in <em>src/main.rs</em>:</p>

<p>With the remaining program logic separated into the <code>run</code> function, we can
improve the error handling, as we did with <code>Config::new</code> in Listing 12-9.
Instead of allowing the program to panic by calling <code>expect</code>, the <code>run</code>
function will return a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> when something goes wrong. This will let
us further consolidate into <code>main</code> the logic around handling errors in a
user-friendly way. Listing 12-12 shows the changes we need to make to the

    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-12: Changing the <code>run</code> function to return
<code>Result</code></span></p>
<p>We’ve made three significant changes here. First, we changed the return type of
the <code>run</code> function to <code>Result&lt;(), Box&lt;Error&gt;&gt;</code>. This function previously
returned the unit type, <code>()</code>, and we keep that as the value returned in the
<code>Ok</code> case.</p>
<p>For the error type, we used the <em>trait object</em> <code>Box&lt;Error&gt;</code> (and we’ve brought
<code>std::error::Error</code> into scope with a <code>use</code> statement at the top). We’ll cover
trait objects in Chapter 17. For now, just know that <code>Box&lt;Error&gt;</code> means the
function will return a type that implements the <code>Error</code> trait, but we don’t
have to specify what particular type the return value will be. This gives us
flexibility to return error values that may be of different types in different
error cases.</p>
<p>Second, we’ve removed the calls to <code>expect</code> in favor of <code>?</code>, as we talked about
in Chapter 9. Rather than <code>panic!</code> on an error, <code>?</code> will return the error value
from the current function for the caller to handle.</p>
<p>Third, the <code>run</code> function now returns an <code>Ok</code> value in the success case. We’ve
declared the <code>run</code> function’s success type as <code>()</code> in the signature, which
means we need to wrap the unit type value in the <code>Ok</code> value. This <code>Ok(())</code>
syntax might look a bit strange at first, but using <code>()</code> like this is the
idiomatic way to indicate that we’re calling <code>run</code> for its side effects only;
it doesn’t return a value we need.</p>
<p>When you run this code, it will compile but will display a warning:</p>

<p>Rust tells us that our code ignored the <code>Result</code> value, and the <code>Result</code> value
might indicate that an error occurred. But we’re not checking to see whether or
not there was an error, and the compiler reminds us that we probably meant to
have some error handling code here! Let’s rectify that problem now.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#handling-errors-returned-from-run-in-main" id="handling-errors-returned-from-run-in-main"><h4>Handling Errors Returned from <code>run</code> in <code>main</code></h4></a>
<p>We’ll check for errors and handle them using a technique similar to the way we
handled errors with <code>Config::new</code> in Listing 12-10, but with a slight
difference:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    // --snip--

    println!(&quot;Searching for {}&quot;, config.query);
    println!(&quot;In file {}&quot;, config.filename);

    if let Err(e) = run(config) {
        println!(&quot;Application error: {}&quot;, e);

        process::exit(1);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We use <code>if let</code> rather than <code>unwrap_or_else</code> to check whether <code>run</code> returns an
<code>Err</code> value and call <code>process::exit(1)</code> if it does. The <code>run</code> function doesn’t
return a value that we want to <code>unwrap</code> in the same way that <code>Config::new</code>
returns the <code>Config</code> instance. Because <code>run</code> returns a <code>()</code> in the success
case, we only care about detecting an error, so we don’t need <code>unwrap_or_else</code>
to return the unwrapped value because it would only be <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>The bodies of the <code>if let</code> and the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> functions are the same in
both cases: we print the error and exit.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#splitting-code-into-a-library-crate" id="splitting-code-into-a-library-crate"><h3>Splitting Code into a Library Crate</h3></a>
<p>Our <code>minigrep</code> project is looking good so far! Now we’ll split the
<em>src/main.rs</em> file and put some code into the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file so we can test
it and have a <em>src/main.rs</em> file with fewer responsibilities.</p>
<p>Let’s move all the code that isn’t the <code>main</code> function from <em>src/main.rs</em> to
<em>src/lib.rs</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>run</code> function definition</li>
<li>The relevant <code>use</code> statements</li>
<li>The definition of <code>Config</code></li>
<li>The <code>Config::new</code> function definition</li>
</ul>
<p>The contents of <em>src/lib.rs</em> should have the signatures shown in Listing 12-13
(we’ve omitted the bodies of the functions for brevity):</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>

    }
}

pub fn run(config: Config) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;Error&gt;&gt; {

<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-13: Moving <code>Config</code> and <code>run</code> into
<em>src/lib.rs</em></span></p>
<p>We’ve made liberal use of <code>pub</code> here: on <code>Config</code>, its fields and its <code>new</code>
method, and on the <code>run</code> function. We now have a library crate that has a
public API that we can test!</p>
<p>Now we need to bring the code we moved to <em>src/lib.rs</em> into the scope of the
binary crate in <em>src/main.rs</em>, as shown in Listing 12-14:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate minigrep;

use std::env;
use std::process;

use minigrep::Config;

fn main() {
    // --snip--
    if let Err(e) = minigrep::run(config) {
        // --snip--
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-14: Bringing the <code>minigrep</code> crate into the
scope of <em>src/main.rs</em></span></p>
<p>To bring the library crate into the binary crate, we use <code>extern crate minigrep</code>. Then we’ll add a <code>use minigrep::Config</code> line to bring the <code>Config</code>
type into scope, and we’ll prefix the <code>run</code> function with our crate name. Now
all the functionality should be connected and should work. Run the program with
<code>cargo run</code> and make sure everything works correctly.</p>
<p>Whew! That was a lot of work, but we’ve set ourselves up for success in the
future. Now it’s much easier to handle errors, and we’ve made the code more
modular. Almost all of our work will be done in <em>src/lib.rs</em> from here on out.</p>
<p>Let’s take advantage of this newfound modularity by doing something that would
have been difficult with the old code but is easy with the new code: we’ll
write some tests!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#developing-the-librarys-functionality-with-test-driven-development" id="developing-the-librarys-functionality-with-test-driven-development"><h2>Developing the Library’s Functionality with Test Driven Development</h2></a>
<p>Now that we’ve extracted the logic into <em>src/lib.rs</em> and left the argument
collecting and error handling in <em>src/main.rs</em>, it’s much easier to write tests
for the core functionality of our code. We can call functions directly with
various arguments and check return values without having to call our binary
from the command line. Feel free to write some tests for the functionality in
the <code>Config::new</code> and <code>run</code> functions on your own.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll add the searching logic to the <code>minigrep</code> program by
using the Test Driven Development (TDD) process. This software development
technique follows these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a test that fails, and run it to make sure it fails for the reason you
expected.</li>
<li>Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass.</li>
<li>Refactor the code you just added or changed, and make sure the tests
continue to pass.</li>
<li>Repeat from step 1!</li>
</ol>
<p>This process is just one of many ways to write software, but TDD can help drive
code design as well. Writing the test before you write the code that makes the
test pass helps to maintain high test coverage throughout the process.</p>
<p>We’ll test drive the implementation of the functionality that will actually do
the searching for the query string in the file contents and produce a list of
lines that match the query. We’ll add this functionality in a function called
<code>search</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#writing-a-failing-test" id="writing-a-failing-test"><h3>Writing a Failing Test</h3></a>
<p>Because we don’t need them anymore, let’s remove the <code>println!</code> statements from
<em>src/lib.rs</em> and <em>src/main.rs</em> that we used to check the program’s behavior.
Then, in <em>src/lib.rs</em>, we’ll add a <code>test</code> module with a test function, as we
did in Chapter 11. The test function specifies the behavior we want the
<code>search</code> function to have: it will take a query and the text to search for the
query in, and will return only the lines from the text that contain the query.
Listing 12-15 shows this test:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# fn search&lt;'a&gt;(query: &amp;str, contents: &amp;'a str) -&gt; Vec&lt;&amp;'a str&gt; {

# }
#
#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn one_result() {
        let query = &quot;duct&quot;;
        let contents = &quot;\

Pick three.&quot;;

        assert_eq!(
            vec![&quot;safe, fast, productive.&quot;],
            search(query, contents)
        );
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-15: Creating a failing test for the <code>search</code>
function we wish we had</span></p>
<p>This test searches for the string “duct.” The text we’re searching is three
lines, only one of which contains “duct.” We assert that the value returned
from the <code>search</code> function contains only the line we expect.</p>
<p>We aren’t able to run this test and watch it fail because the test doesn’t even
compile: the <code>search</code> function doesn’t exist yet! So now we’ll add just enough
code to get the test to compile and run by adding a definition of the <code>search</code>
function that always returns an empty vector, as shown in Listing 12-16. Then
the test should compile and fail because an empty vector doesn’t match a vector
containing the line <code>&quot;safe, fast, productive.&quot;</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub fn search&lt;'a&gt;(query: &amp;str, contents: &amp;'a str) -&gt; Vec&lt;&amp;'a str&gt; {
    vec![]
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-16: Defining just enough of the <code>search</code>
function so our test will compile</span></p>
<p>Notice that we need an explicit lifetime <code>'a</code> defined in the signature of
<code>search</code> and used with the <code>contents</code> argument and the return value. Recall in
Chapter 10 that the lifetime parameters specify which argument lifetime is
connected to the lifetime of the return value. In this case, we indicate that
the returned vector should contain string slices that reference slices of the
argument <code>contents</code> (rather than the argument <code>query</code>).</p>
<p>In other words, we tell Rust that the data returned by the <code>search</code> function
will live as long as the data passed into the <code>search</code> function in the
<code>contents</code> argument. This is important! The data referenced <em>by</em> a slice needs
to be valid for the reference to be valid; if the compiler assumes we’re making
string slices of <code>query</code> rather than <code>contents</code>, it will do its safety checking
incorrectly.</p>
<p>If we forget the lifetime annotations and try to compile this function, we’ll
get this error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --&gt; src/lib.rs:5:51

  |
  = help: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but the
  signature does not say whether it is borrowed from `query` or `contents`
</code></pre>
<p>Rust can’t possibly know which of the two arguments we need, so we need to tell
it. Because <code>contents</code> is the argument that contains all of our text and we
want to return the parts of that text that match, we know <code>contents</code> is the
argument that should be connected to the return value using the lifetime syntax.</p>
<p>Other programming languages don’t require you to connect arguments to return
values in the signature, so although this might seem strange, it will get
easier over time. You might want to compare this example with “Validating
References with Lifetimes” in Chapter 10 on page XX.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Great, the test fails, exactly as we expected. Let’s get the test to pass!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#writing-code-to-pass-the-test" id="writing-code-to-pass-the-test"><h3>Writing Code to Pass the Test</h3></a>
<p>Currently, our test is failing because we always return an empty vector. To fix
that and implement <code>search</code>, our program needs to follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iterate through each line of the contents.</li>
<li>Check whether the line contains our query string.</li>
<li>If it does, add it to the list of values we’re returning.</li>
<li>If it doesn’t, do nothing.</li>
<li>Return the list of results that match.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s work through each step, starting with iterating through lines.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#iterating-through-lines-with-the-lines-method" id="iterating-through-lines-with-the-lines-method"><h4>Iterating Through Lines with the <code>lines</code> Method</h4></a>
<p>Rust has a helpful method to handle line-by-line iteration of strings,
conveniently named <code>lines</code>, that works as shown in Listing 12-17. Note this
won’t compile yet:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn search&lt;'a&gt;(query: &amp;str, contents: &amp;'a str) -&gt; Vec&lt;&amp;'a str&gt; {
    for line in contents.lines() {
        // do something with line
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-17: Iterating through each line in <code>contents</code>
</span></p>
<p>The <code>lines</code> method returns an iterator. We’ll talk about iterators in depth in
Chapter 13, but recall that you saw this way of using an iterator in Listing
3-4, where we used a <code>for</code> loop with an iterator to run some code on each item
in a collection.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#searching-each-line-for-the-query" id="searching-each-line-for-the-query"><h4>Searching Each Line for the Query</h4></a>
<p>Next, we’ll check whether the current line contains our query string.
Fortunately, strings have a helpful method named <code>contains</code> that does this for
us! Add a call to the <code>contains</code> method in the <code>search</code> function, as shown in
Listing 12-18. Note this still won’t compile yet:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn search&lt;'a&gt;(query: &amp;str, contents: &amp;'a str) -&gt; Vec&lt;&amp;'a str&gt; {
    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.contains(query) {
            // do something with line
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-18: Adding functionality to see whether the
line contains the string in <code>query</code></span></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#storing-matching-lines" id="storing-matching-lines"><h4>Storing Matching Lines</h4></a>
<p>We also need a way to store the lines that contain our query string. For that,
we can make a mutable vector before the <code>for</code> loop and call the <code>push</code> method
to store a <code>line</code> in the vector. After the <code>for</code> loop, we return the vector, as
shown in Listing 12-19:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn search&lt;'a&gt;(query: &amp;str, contents: &amp;'a str) -&gt; Vec&lt;&amp;'a str&gt; {
    let mut results = Vec::new();

    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.contains(query) {
            results.push(line);
        }
    }

    results
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-19: Storing the lines that match so we can
return them</span></p>
<p>Now the <code>search</code> function should return only the lines that contain <code>query</code>,
and our test should pass. Let’s run the test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo test
--snip--
running 1 test
test test::one_result ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre>
<p>Our test passed, so we know it works!</p>
<p>At this point, we could consider opportunities for refactoring the
implementation of the search function while keeping the tests passing to
maintain the same functionality. The code in the search function isn’t too bad,
but it doesn’t take advantage of some useful features of iterators. We’ll
return to this example in Chapter 13 where we’ll explore iterators in detail
and look at how to improve it.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-the-search-function-in-the-run-function" id="using-the-search-function-in-the-run-function"><h4>Using the <code>search</code> Function in the <code>run</code> Function</h4></a>
<p>Now that the <code>search</code> function is working and tested, we need to call <code>search</code>
from our <code>run</code> function. We need to pass the <code>config.query</code> value and the
<code>contents</code> that <code>run</code> reads from the file to the <code>search</code> function. Then <code>run</code>
will print each line returned from <code>search</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn run(config: Config) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;Error&gt;&gt; {
    let mut f = File::open(config.filename)?;

    let mut contents = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&amp;mut contents)?;

    for line in search(&amp;config.query, &amp;contents) {
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, line);
    }

    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<p>We’re still using a <code>for</code> loop to return each line from <code>search</code> and print it.</p>
<p>Now the entire program should work! Let’s try it out, first with a word that
should return exactly one line from the Emily Dickinson poem, “frog”:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run frog poem.txt

<p>Cool! Now let’s try a word that will match multiple lines, like “body”:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run body poem.txt

     Running `target/debug/minigrep body poem.txt`
I’m nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, let’s make sure that we don’t get any lines when we search for a
word that isn’t anywhere in the poem, such as “monomorphization”:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run monomorphization poem.txt
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/minigrep monomorphization poem.txt`
</code></pre>
<p>Excellent! We’ve built our own mini version of a classic tool and learned a lot
about how to structure applications. We’ve also learned a bit about file input
and output, lifetimes, testing, and command line parsing.</p>
<p>To round out this project, we’ll briefly demonstrate how to work with
environment variables and how to print to standard error, both of which are
useful when you’re writing command line programs.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#working-with-environment-variables" id="working-with-environment-variables"><h2>Working with Environment Variables</h2></a>
<p>We’ll improve <code>minigrep</code> by adding an extra feature: an option for
case-insensitive searching that the user can turn on via an environment
variable. We could make this feature a command line option and require that
users enter it each time they want it to apply, but instead we’ll use an
environment variable. Doing so allows our users to set the environment variable
once and have all their searches be case insensitive in that terminal session.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#writing-a-failing-test-for-the-case-insensitive-search-function" id="writing-a-failing-test-for-the-case-insensitive-search-function"><h3>Writing a Failing Test for the Case-Insensitive <code>search</code> Function</h3></a>
<p>We want to add a new <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function that we’ll call when
the environment variable is on. We’ll continue to follow the TDD process, so
the first step is again to write a failing test. We’ll add a new test for the
new <code>search``_case_insensitive</code> function and rename our old test from
<code>one_result</code> to <code>case_sensitive</code> to clarify the differences between the two
tests, as shown in Listing 12-20:</p>

<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">

        let contents = &quot;\

    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-20: Adding a new failing test for the
case-insensitive function we’re about to add</span></p>
<p>Note that we’ve edited the old test’s <code>contents</code> too. We’ve added a new line
with the text <code>“Duct tape”</code> using a capital D that shouldn’t match the query
“duct” when we’re searching in a case-sensitive manner. Changing the old test
in this way helps ensure that we don’t accidentally break the case-sensitive
search functionality that we’ve already implemented. This test should pass now
and should continue to pass as we work on the case-insensitive search.</p>
<p>The new test for the case-<em>insensitive</em> search uses “rUsT” as its query. In the
<code>search_case_insensitive</code> function we’re about to add, the query “rUsT” should
match the line containing “Rust:” with a capital R and also the line “Trust
me.” even though both have different casing than the query. This is our failing
test, and it will fail to compile because we haven’t yet defined the
<code>search_case_insensitive</code> function. Feel free to add a skeleton implementation
that always returns an empty vector, similar to the way we did for the <code>search</code>
function in Listing 12-16 to see the test compile and fail.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#implementing-the-search_case_insensitive-function" id="implementing-the-search_case_insensitive-function"><h3>Implementing the <code>search_case_insensitive</code> Function</h3></a>
<p>The <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function, shown in Listing 12-21, will be almost
the same as the <code>search</code> function. The only difference is that we’ll lowercase
the <code>query</code> and each <code>line</code> so whatever the case of the input arguments,
they’ll be the same case when we check whether the line contains the query:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn search_case_insensitive&lt;'a&gt;(query: &amp;str, contents: &amp;'a str) -&gt; Vec&lt;&amp;'a str&gt; {
    let query = query.to_lowercase();
    let mut results = Vec::new();

    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.to_lowercase().contains(&amp;query) {
            results.push(line);
        }
    }

    results
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-21: Defining the <code>search_case_insensitive</code>
function to lowercase the query and the line before comparing them</span></p>
<p>First, we lowercase the <code>query</code> string and store it in a shadowed variable with
the same name. Calling <code>to_lowercase</code> on the query is necessary so no matter
whether the user’s query is “rust”, “RUST”, “Rust”, or “rUsT”, we’ll treat the
query as if it was “rust” and be insensitive to the case.</p>
<p>Note that <code>query</code> is now a <code>String</code> rather than a string slice, because calling
<code>to_lowercase</code> creates new data rather than referencing existing data. Say the
query is “rUsT”, as an example: that string slice doesn’t contain a lowercase
“u” or “t” for us to use, so we have to allocate a new <code>String</code> containing
“rust”. When we pass <code>query</code> as an argument to the <code>contains</code> method now, we
need to add an ampersand because the signature of <code>contains</code> is defined to take
a string slice.</p>
<p>Next, we add a call to <code>to_lowercase</code> on each <code>line</code> before we check whether it
contains <code>query</code> to lowercase all characters. Now that we’ve converted <code>line</code>
and <code>query</code> to lowercase, we’ll find matches no matter what the case of the
query is.</p>
<p>Let’s see if this implementation passes the tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">running 2 tests
test test::case_insensitive ... ok
test test::case_sensitive ... ok

test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre>
<p>Great! They passed. Now, let’s call the new <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function
from the <code>run</code> function. First, we’ll add a configuration option to the
<code>Config</code> struct to switch between case-sensitive and case-insensitive search.
Adding this field will cause compiler errors since we aren’t initializing this
field anywhere yet:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub struct Config {
    pub query: String,
    pub filename: String,
    pub case_sensitive: bool,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that we added the <code>case_sensitive</code> field that holds a Boolean. Next, we
need the <code>run</code> function to check the <code>case_sensitive</code> field’s value and use
that to decide whether to call the <code>search</code> function or the
<code>search_case_insensitive</code> function, as shown in Listing 12-22. Note this still

<p>Finally, we need to check for the environment variable. The functions for
working with environment variables are in the <code>env</code> module in the standard
library, so we want to bring that module into scope with a <code>use std::env;</code> line
at the top of <em>src/lib.rs</em>. Then we’ll use the <code>var</code> method from the <code>env</code>
module to check for an environment variable named <code>CASE_INSENSITIVE</code>, as shown
in Listing 12-23:</p>

        Ok(Config { query, filename, case_sensitive })
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-23: Checking for an environment variable named
<code>CASE_INSENSITIVE</code></span></p>
<p>Here, we create a new variable <code>case_sensitive</code>. To set its value, we call the
<code>env::var</code> function and pass it the name of the <code>CASE_INSENSITIVE</code> environment
variable. The <code>env::var</code> method returns a <code>Result</code> that will be the successful
<code>Ok</code> variant that contains the value of the environment variable if the
environment variable is set. It will return the <code>Err</code> variant if the
environment variable is not set.</p>
<p>We’re using the <code>is_err</code> method on the <code>Result</code> to check whether it’s an error
and therefore unset, which means it <em>should</em> do a case-sensitive search. If the
<code>CASE_INSENSITIVE</code> environment variable is set to anything, <code>is_err</code> will
return false and will perform a case-insensitive search. We don’t care about
the <em>value</em> of the environment variable, just whether it’s set or unset, so
we’re checking <code>is_err</code> rather than <code>unwrap</code>, <code>expect</code>, or any of the other
methods we’ve seen on <code>Result</code>.</p>
<p>We pass the value in the <code>case_sensitive</code> variable to the <code>Config</code> instance so
the <code>run</code> function can read that value and decide whether to call <code>search</code> or
<code>search_case_insensitive</code> as we implemented in Listing 12-22.</p>
<p>Let’s give it a try! First, we’ll run our program without the environment
variable set and with the query “to”, which should match any line that contains
the word “to” in all lowercase:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run to poem.txt
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/minigrep to poem.txt`
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like that still works! Now, let’s run the program with <code>CASE_INSENSITIVE</code>
set to <code>1</code> but with the same query “to”; we should get lines that contain “to”
that might have uppercase letters:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ CASE_INSENSITIVE=1 cargo run to poem.txt
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/minigrep to poem.txt`
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
</code></pre>
<p>If you’re using PowerShell, you will need to set the environment variable and
run the program in two commands rather than one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ $env.CASE_INSENSITIVE=1
$ cargo run to poem.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Excellent, we also got lines containing “To”! Our <code>minigrep</code> program can now do
case-insensitive searching controlled by an environment variable. Now you know
how to manage options set using either command line arguments or environment
variables!</p>
<p>Some programs allow arguments <em>and</em> environment variables for the same
configuration. In those cases, the programs decide that one or the other takes
precedence. For another exercise on your own, try controlling case
insensitivity through either a command line argument or an environment
variable. Decide whether the command line argument or the environment variable
should take precedence if the program is run with one set to case sensitive and
one set to case insensitive.</p>
<p>The <code>std::env</code> module contains many more useful features for dealing with
environment variables: check out its documentation to see what is available.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#writing-error-messages-to-standard-error-instead-of-standard-output" id="writing-error-messages-to-standard-error-instead-of-standard-output"><h2>Writing Error Messages to Standard Error Instead of Standard Output</h2></a>
<p>At the moment we’re writing all of our output to the terminal using the
<code>println!</code> function. Most terminals provide two kinds of output: <em>standard
out</em><em>put</em> (<code>stdout</code>) for general information and <em>standard error</em> (<code>stderr</code>)
for error messages. This distinction enables users to choose to direct the
successful output of a program to a file but still print error messages to the
screen.</p>
<p>The <code>println!</code> function is only capable of printing to standard output, so we
have to use something else to print to standard error.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#checking-where-errors-are-written-to" id="checking-where-errors-are-written-to"><h3>Checking Where Errors Are Written to</h3></a>
<p>First, let’s observe how the content printed by <code>minigrep</code> is currently being
written to standard output, including any error messages we want to write to
standard error instead. We’ll do that by redirecting the standard output stream
to a file while also intentionally causing an error. We won’t redirect the
standard error stream, so any content sent to standard error will continue to
display on the screen.</p>
<p>Command line programs are expected to send error messages to the standard error
stream so we can still see error messages on the screen even if we redirect the
standard output stream to a file. Our program is not currently well-behaved:
we’re about to see that it saves the error message output to a file instead!</p>
<p>The way to demonstrate this behavior is by running the program with <code>&gt;</code> and the
filename, <em>output.txt</em>, that we want to redirect the standard output stream to.
We won’t pass any arguments, which should cause an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&gt;</code> syntax tells the shell to write the contents of standard output to
<em>output.txt</em> instead of the screen. We didn’t see the error message we were
expecting printed on the screen, so that means it must have ended up in the
file. This is what <em>output.txt</em> contains:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Problem parsing arguments: not enough arguments
</code></pre>
<p>Yup, our error message is being printed to standard output. It’s much more
useful for error messages like this to be printed to standard error and have
only data from a successful run end up in the file when we redirect standard
output this way. We’ll change that.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#printing-errors-to-standard-error" id="printing-errors-to-standard-error"><h3>Printing Errors to Standard Error</h3></a>
<p>We’ll use the code in Listing 12-24 to change how error messages are printed.
Because of the refactoring we did earlier in this chapter, all the code that
prints error messages is in one function, <code>main</code>. The standard library provides
the <code>eprintln!</code> macro that prints to the standard error stream, so let’s change
the two places we were calling <code>println!</code> to print errors to use <code>eprintln!</code>
instead:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();

    let config = Config::new(&amp;args).unwrap_or_else(|err| {
        eprintln!(&quot;Problem parsing arguments: {}&quot;, err);
        process::exit(1);
    });

    if let Err(e) = minigrep::run(config) {
        eprintln!(&quot;Application error: {}&quot;, e);

        process::exit(1);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-24: Writing error messages to standard error
instead of standard output using <code>eprintln!</code></span></p>
<p>After changing <code>println!</code> to <code>eprintln!</code>, let’s run the program again in the
same way, without any arguments and redirecting standard output with <code>&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run &gt; output.txt
Problem parsing arguments: not enough arguments
</code></pre>
<p>Now we see the error onscreen and <em>output.txt</em> contains nothing, which is the
behavior we expect of command line programs.</p>
<p>Let’s run the program again with arguments that don’t cause an error but still
redirect standard output to a file, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run to poem.txt &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
<p>We won’t see any output to the terminal, and <em>output.txt</em> will contain our
results:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: output.txt</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
</code></pre>
<p>This demonstrates that we’re now using standard output for successful output
and standard error for error output as appropriate.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#summary-10" id="summary-10"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>In this chapter, we’ve recapped some of the major concepts you’ve learned so
far and covered how to do common I/O operations in a Rust context. By using
command line arguments, files, environment variables, and the <code>eprintln!</code> macro
for printing errors, you’re now prepared to write command line applications. By
using the concepts in previous chapters, your code will be well organized,
store data effectively in the appropriate data structures, handle errors
nicely, and be well tested.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll explore some Rust features that were influenced by functional
languages: closures and iterators.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#functional-language-features-iterators-and-closures" id="functional-language-features-iterators-and-closures"><h1>Functional Language Features: Iterators and Closures</h1></a>
<p>Rust’s design has taken inspiration from many existing languages and
techniques, and one significant influence is <em>functional programming</em>.
Programming in a functional style often includes using functions as values by
passing them in arguments, returning them from other functions, assigning them
to variables for later execution, and so forth. In this chapter, we won’t
debate the issue of what functional programming is or isn’t but will instead
discuss some features of Rust that are similar to features in many languages
often referred to as functional.</p>
<p>More specifically, we’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Closures</em>, a function-like construct you can store in a variable</li>
<li><em>Iterators</em>, a way of processing a series of elements</li>
<li>How to use these two features to improve the I/O project in Chapter 12</li>
<li>The performance of these two features (Spoiler alert: they’re faster than you
might think!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other Rust features are influenced by the functional style as well, such as
pattern matching and enums, which we’ve covered in other chapters. Mastering
closures and iterators is an important part of writing idiomatic, fast Rust
code, so we’ll devote this entire chapter to them.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#closures-anonymous-functions-that-can-capture-their-environment" id="closures-anonymous-functions-that-can-capture-their-environment"><h2>Closures: Anonymous Functions that Can Capture Their Environment</h2></a>
<p>Rust’s <em>closures</em> are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or pass as
arguments to other functions. You can create the closure in one place, and then
call the closure to evaluate it in a different context. Unlike functions,
closures can capture values from the scope in which they’re called. We’ll
demonstrate how these closure features allow for code reuse and behavior
customization.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-an-abstraction-of-behavior-with-closures" id="creating-an-abstraction-of-behavior-with-closures"><h3>Creating an Abstraction of Behavior with Closures</h3></a>
<p>Let’s work on an example of a situation in which it’s useful to store a closure
to be executed at a later time. Along the way, we’ll talk about the syntax of
closures, type inference, and traits.</p>
<p>Consider this hypothetical situation: we work at a startup that’s making an app
to generate custom exercise workout plans. The backend is written in Rust, and
the algorithm that generates the workout plan takes into account many different
factors, such as the app user’s age, body mass index, preferences, recent
workouts, and an intensity number they specify. The actual algorithm used isn’t
important in this example; what’s important is that this calculation takes a
few seconds. We want to call this algorithm only when we need to and only call
it once, so we don’t make the user wait more than necessary.</p>
<p>We’ll simulate calling this hypothetical algorithm with the
<code>simulated_expensive_calculation</code> function shown in Listing 13-1, which will
print <code>calculating slowly...</code>, wait for two seconds, and then return whatever
number we passed in:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity: u32) -&gt; u32 {
    println!(&quot;calculating slowly...&quot;);
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
    intensity
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-1: A function to stand in for a hypothetical
calculation that takes about two seconds to run</span></p>
<p>Next is the <code>main</code> function that contains the parts of the workout app
important for this example. This function represents the code that the app will
call when a user asks for a workout plan. Because the interaction with the
app’s frontend isn’t relevant to the use of closures, we’ll hardcode values
representing inputs to our program and print the outputs.</p>
<p>The required inputs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>An intensity number from the user</em>, which is specified when they request
a workout to indicate whether they want a low-intensity workout or a
high-intensity workout.</li>
<li><em>A random number</em> that will generate some variety in the workout plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>The output will be the recommended workout plan. Listing 13-2 shows the <code>main</code>
function we’ll use:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let simulated_user_specified_value = 10;
    let simulated_random_number = 7;

    generate_workout(
        simulated_user_specified_value,
        simulated_random_number
    );
}
# fn generate_workout(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) {}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-2: A <code>main</code> function with hardcoded values to
simulate user input and random number generation</span></p>
<p>We’ve hardcoded the variable <code>simulated_user_specified_value</code> to 10 and the
variable <code>simulated_random_number</code> to 7 for simplicity’s sake; in an actual
program, we’d get the intensity number from the app frontend and we’d use the
<code>rand</code> crate to generate a random number, as we did in the Guessing Game
example in Chapter 2. The <code>main</code> function calls a <code>generate_workout</code> function
with the simulated input values.</p>
<p>Now that we have the context, let’s get to the algorithm. The
<code>generate_workout</code> function in Listing 13-3 contains the business logic of the
app that we’re most concerned with in this example. The rest of the code
changes in this example will be made to this function:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

        } else {
            println!(
                &quot;Today, run for {} minutes!&quot;,
                simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity)
            );
        }
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-3: The business logic that prints the workout
plans based on the inputs and calls to the <code>simulated_expensive_calculation</code>
function</span></p>
<p>The code in Listing 13-3 has multiple calls to the slow calculation function.
The first <code>if</code> block calls <code>simulated_expensive_calculation</code> twice, the <code>if</code>
inside the outer <code>else</code> doesn’t call it at all, and the code inside the
second <code>else</code> case calls it once.</p>
<!-- NEXT PARAGRAPH WRAPPED WEIRD INTENTIONALLY SEE #199 -->
<p>The desired behavior of the <code>generate_workout</code> function is to first check
whether the user wants a low-intensity workout (indicated by a number less
than 25) or a high-intensity workout (a number of 25 or greater).</p>
<p>Low-intensity workout plans will recommend a number of push-ups and sit-ups
based on the complex algorithm we’re simulating.</p>
<p>If the user wants a high-intensity workout, there’s some additional logic: if
the value of the random number generated by the app happens to be 3, the app
will recommend a break and hydration. If not, the user will get a number of
minutes of running based on the complex algorithm.</p>
<p>The data science team has let us know that we’ll have to make some changes to
the way we call the algorithm in the future. To simplify the update when those
changes happen, we want to refactor this code so it calls the
<code>simulated_expensive_calculation</code> function only once. We also want to cut the
place where we’re currently unnecessarily calling the function twice without
adding any other calls to that function in the process. That is, we don’t want
to call it if the result isn’t needed, and we still want to call it only once.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#refactoring-using-functions" id="refactoring-using-functions"><h4>Refactoring Using Functions</h4></a>
<p>We could restructure the workout program in many ways. First, we’ll try
extracting the duplicated call to the <code>expensive_calculation</code> function into
a variable, as shown in Listing 13-4:</p>

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-4: Extracting the calls to
<code>simulated_expensive_calculation</code> to one place and storing the result in the
<code>expensive_result</code> variable</span></p>
<p>This change unifies all the calls to <code>simulated_expensive_calculation</code> and
solves the problem of the first <code>if</code> block unnecessarily calling the function
twice. Unfortunately, we’re now calling this function and waiting for the
result in all cases, which includes the inner <code>if</code> block that doesn’t use the
result value at all.</p>
<p>We want to define code in one place in our program, but only <em>execute</em> that
code where we actually need the result. This is a use case for closures!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#refactoring-with-closures-to-store-code" id="refactoring-with-closures-to-store-code"><h4>Refactoring with Closures to Store Code</h4></a>
<p>Instead of always calling the <code>simulated_expensive_calculation</code> function before
the <code>if</code> blocks, we can define a closure and store the <em>closure</em> in a variable
rather than storing the result, as shown in Listing 13-5. We can actually move
the whole body of <code>simulated_expensive_calculation</code> within the closure we’re
introducing here:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# use std::thread;
# use std::time::Duration;
#
let expensive_closure = |num| {
    println!(&quot;calculating slowly...&quot;);
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
    num
};
# expensive_closure(5);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-5: Defining a closure and storing it in the
<code>expensive_closure</code> variable</span></p>
<p>The closure definition comes after the <code>=</code> to assign it to the variable
<code>expensive_closure</code>. To define a closure, we start with a pair of vertical
pipes (<code>|</code>), inside which we specify the parameters to the closure; this syntax
was chosen because of its similarity to closure definitions in Smalltalk and
Ruby. This closure has one parameter named <code>num</code>: if we had more than one
parameter, we would separate them with commas, like <code>|param1, param2|</code>.</p>
<p>After the parameters, we place curly brackets that hold the body of the
closure—these are optional if the closure body is a single expression. The end
of the closure, after the curly brackets, needs a semicolon to complete the
<code>let</code> statement. The value returned from the last line in the closure body
(<code>num</code>) will be the value returned from the closure when it’s called, because
that line doesn’t end in a semicolon; just like in function bodies.</p>
<p>Note that this <code>let</code> statement means <code>expensive_closure</code> contains the
<em>definition</em> of an anonymous function, not the <em>resulting value</em> of calling the
anonymous function. Recall that we’re using a closure because we want to define
the code to call at one point, store that code, and call it at a later point;
the code we want to call is now stored in <code>expensive_closure</code>.</p>
<p>With the closure defined, we can change the code in the <code>if</code> blocks to call the
closure to execute the code and get the resulting value. We call a closure like
we do a function: we specify the variable name that holds the closure
definition and follow it with parentheses containing the argument values we
want to use, as shown in Listing 13-6:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-6: Calling the <code>expensive_closure</code> we’ve
defined</span></p>
<p>Now the expensive calculation is called in only one place, and we’re only
executing that code where we need the results.</p>
<p>However, we’ve reintroduced one of the problems from Listing 13-3: we’re still
calling the closure twice in the first <code>if</code> block, which will call the
expensive code twice and make the user wait twice as long as they need to. We
could fix this problem by creating a variable local to that <code>if</code> block to hold
the result of calling the closure, but closures provide us with another
solution. We’ll talk about that solution in a bit. But first let’s talk about
why there aren’t type annotations in the closure definition and the traits
involved with closures.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#closure-type-inference-and-annotation" id="closure-type-inference-and-annotation"><h3>Closure Type Inference and Annotation</h3></a>
<p>Closures don’t require you to annotate the types of the parameters or the
return value like <code>fn</code> functions do. Type annotations are required on functions
because they’re part of an explicit interface exposed to your users. Defining
this interface rigidly is important for ensuring that everyone agrees on what
types of values a function uses and returns. But closures aren’t used in an
exposed interface like this: they’re stored in variables and used without
naming them and exposing them to users of our library.</p>
<p>Additionally, closures are usually short and only relevant within a narrow
context rather than in any arbitrary scenario. Within these limited contexts,
the compiler is reliably able to infer the types of the parameters and return
type, similar to how it’s able to infer the types of most variables.</p>
<p>Making programmers annotate the types in these small, anonymous functions would
be annoying and largely redundant with the information the compiler already has
available.</p>
<p>Like variables, we can add type annotations if we want to increase explicitness
and clarity at the cost of being more verbose than is strictly necessary;
annotating the types for the closure we defined in Listing 13-4 would look like
the definition shown in Listing 13-7:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# use std::thread;
# use std::time::Duration;
#
let expensive_closure = |num: u32| -&gt; u32 {
    println!(&quot;calculating slowly...&quot;);
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
    num
};
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-7: Adding optional type annotations of the
parameter and return value types in the closure</span></p>
<p>The syntax of closures and functions looks more similar with type annotations.
The following is a vertical comparison of the syntax for the definition of a
function that adds one to its parameter, and a closure that has the same
behavior. We’ve added some spaces to line up the relevant parts. This
illustrates how closure syntax is similar to function syntax except for the use
of pipes and the amount of syntax that is optional:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -&gt; u32 { x + 1 }
let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -&gt; u32 { x + 1 };
let add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 };
let add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1  ;
</code></pre>
<p>The first line shows a function definition, and the second line shows a fully
annotated closure definition. The third line removes the type annotations from
the closure definition, and the fourth line removes the brackets that are
optional, because the closure body has only one expression. These are all valid
definitions that will produce the same behavior when they’re called.</p>
<p>Closure definitions will have one concrete type inferred for each of their
parameters and for their return value. For instance, Listing 13-8 shows the
definition of a short closure that just returns the value it receives as a
parameter. This closure isn’t very useful except for the purposes of this
example. Note that we haven’t added any type annotations to the definition: if
we then try to call the closure twice, using a <code>String</code> as an argument the
first time and a <code>u32</code> the second time, we’ll get an error:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let example_closure = |x| x;

let s = example_closure(String::from(&quot;hello&quot;));
let n = example_closure(5);
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-8: Attempting to call a closure whose types
are inferred with two different types</span></p>
<p>The compiler gives us this error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0308]: mismatched types

</code></pre>
<p>The first time we call <code>example_closure</code> with the <code>String</code> value, the compiler
infers the type of <code>x</code> and the return type of the closure to be <code>String</code>. Those
types are then locked in to the closure in <code>example_closure</code>, and we get a type
error if we try to use a different type with the same closure.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#storing-closures-using-generic-parameters-and-the-fn-traits" id="storing-closures-using-generic-parameters-and-the-fn-traits"><h3>Storing Closures Using Generic Parameters and the <code>Fn</code> Traits</h3></a>
<p>Let’s return to our workout generation app. In Listing 13-6, our code was still
calling the expensive calculation closure more times than it needed to. One
option to solve this issue is to save the result of the expensive closure in a
variable for reuse and use the variable instead in each place we need the
result instead of calling the closure again. However, this method could result
in a lot of repeated code.</p>
<p>Fortunately, another solution is available to us. We can create a struct that
will hold the closure and the resulting value of calling the closure. The
struct will only execute the closure if we need the resulting value, and it
will cache the resulting value so the rest of our code doesn’t have to be
responsible for saving and reusing the result. You may know this pattern as
<em>memoization</em> or <em>lazy evaluation</em>.</p>
<p>To make a struct that holds a closure, we need to specify the type of the
closure, because a struct definition needs to know the types of each of its
fields. Each closure instance has its own unique anonymous type: that is, even
if two closures have the same signature, their types are still considered
different. To define structs, enums, or function parameters that use closures,
we use generics and trait bounds, as we discussed in Chapter 10.</p>
<p>The <code>Fn</code> traits are provided by the standard library. All closures implement
one of the traits: <code>Fn</code>, <code>FnMut</code>, or <code>FnOnce</code>. We’ll discuss the difference
between these traits in the next section on capturing the environment; in this
example, we can use the <code>Fn</code> trait.</p>
<p>We add types to the <code>Fn</code> trait bound to represent the types of the parameters
and return values the closures must have to match this trait bound. In this
case, our closure has a parameter of type <code>u32</code> and returns a <code>u32</code>, so the
trait bound we specify is <code>Fn(u32) -&gt; u32</code>.</p>
<p>Listing 13-9 shows the definition of the <code>Cacher</code> struct that holds a closure
and an optional result value:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
struct Cacher&lt;T&gt;
    where T: Fn(u32) -&gt; u32
{
    calculation: T,
    value: Option&lt;u32&gt;,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-9: Defining a <code>Cacher</code> struct that holds a
closure in <code>calculation</code> and an optional result in <code>value</code></span></p>
<p>The <code>Cacher</code> struct has a <code>calculation</code> field of the generic type <code>T</code>. The
trait bounds on <code>T</code> specify that it’s a closure by using the <code>Fn</code> trait. Any
closure we want to store in the <code>calculation</code> field must have one <code>u32</code>
parameter (specified within the parentheses after <code>Fn</code>) and must return a
<code>u32</code> (specified after the <code>-&gt;</code>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Functions implement all three of the <code>Fn</code> traits too. If what we want
to do doesn’t require capturing a value from the environment, we can use a
function rather than a closure where we need something that implements an <code>Fn</code>
trait.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>value</code> field is of type <code>Option&lt;u32&gt;</code>. Before we execute the closure,
<code>value</code> will be <code>None</code>. When code using a <code>Cacher</code> asks for the <em>result</em> of the
closure, the <code>Cacher</code> will execute the closure at that time and store the
result within a <code>Some</code> variant in the <code>value</code> field. Then if the code asks for
the result of the closure again, instead of executing the closure again, the
<code>Cacher</code> will return the result held in the <code>Some</code> variant.</p>
<p>The logic around the <code>value</code> field we’ve just described is defined in Listing
13-10:</p>

    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-10: The caching logic of <code>Cacher</code></span></p>
<p>We want <code>Cacher</code> to manage the struct fields’ values rather than letting the
calling code potentially change the values in these fields directly, so these
fields are private.</p>
<p>The <code>Cacher::new</code> function takes a generic parameter <code>T</code>, which we’ve defined
as having the same trait bound as the <code>Cacher</code> struct. Then <code>Cacher::new</code>
returns a <code>Cacher</code> instance that holds the closure specified in the
<code>calculation</code> field and a <code>None</code> value in the <code>value</code> field, because we haven’t
executed the closure yet.</p>
<p>When the calling code wants the result of evaluating the closure, instead of
calling the closure directly, it will call the <code>value</code> method. This method
checks whether we already have a resulting value in <code>self.value</code> in a <code>Some</code>;
if we do, it returns the value within the <code>Some</code> without executing the closure
again.</p>
<p>If <code>self.value</code> is <code>None</code>, we call the closure stored in <code>self.calculation</code>,
save the result in <code>self.value</code> for future use, and return the value as well.</p>

<p>Instead of saving the closure in a variable directly, we save a new instance of
<code>Cacher</code> that holds the closure. Then, in each place we want the result, we
call the <code>value</code> method on the <code>Cacher</code> instance. We can call the <code>value</code>
method as many times as we want, or not call it at all, and the expensive

variables to verify that in all the cases in the various <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>
blocks, <code>calculating slowly...</code> only appears once and only when needed. The
<code>Cacher</code> takes care of the logic necessary to ensure we aren’t calling the
expensive calculation more than we need to, so <code>generate_workout</code> can focus on
the business logic.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#limitations-of-the-cacher-implementation" id="limitations-of-the-cacher-implementation"><h3>Limitations of the <code>Cacher</code> Implementation</h3></a>
<p>Caching values is a generally useful behavior that we might want to use in
other parts of our code with different closures. However, there are two
problems with the current implementation of <code>Cacher</code> that would make reusing it
in different contexts difficult.</p>
<p>The first problem is that a <code>Cacher</code> instance assumes it will always get the
same value for the parameter <code>arg</code> to the <code>value</code> method. That is, this test of
<code>Cacher</code> will fail:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[test]
fn call_with_different_values() {
    let mut c = Cacher::new(|a| a);

    let v1 = c.value(1);
    let v2 = c.value(2);

    assert_eq!(v2, 2);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This test creates a new <code>Cacher</code> instance with a closure that returns the value
passed into it. We call the <code>value</code> method on this <code>Cacher</code> instance with an
<code>arg</code> value of 1 and then an <code>arg</code> value of 2, and we expect that the call to
<code>value</code> with the <code>arg</code> value of 2 should return 2.</p>
<p>Run this test with the <code>Cacher</code> implementation in Listing 13-9 and Listing
13-10, and the test will fail on the <code>assert_eq!</code> with this message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'call_with_different_values' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
  left: `1`,
 right: `2`', src/main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that the first time we called <code>c.value</code> with 1, the <code>Cacher</code>
instance saved <code>Some(1)</code> in <code>self.value</code>. Thereafter, no matter what we pass in
to the <code>value</code> method, it will always return 1.</p>
<p>Try modifying <code>Cacher</code> to hold a hash map rather than a single value. The keys
of the hash map will be the <code>arg</code> values that are passed in, and the values of
the hash map will be the result of calling the closure on that key. Instead of
looking at whether <code>self.value</code> directly has a <code>Some</code> or a <code>None</code> value, the
<code>value</code> function will look up the <code>arg</code> in the hash map and return the value if
it’s present. If it’s not present, the <code>Cacher</code> will call the closure and save
the resulting value in the hash map associated with its <code>arg</code> value.</p>
<p>The second problem with the current <code>Cacher</code> implementation is that it only
accepts closures that take one parameter of type <code>u32</code> and return a <code>u32</code>. We
might want to cache the results of closures that take a string slice and return
<code>usize</code> values, for example. To fix this issue, try introducing more generic
parameters to increase the flexibility of the <code>Cacher</code> functionality.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#capturing-the-environment-with-closures" id="capturing-the-environment-with-closures"><h3>Capturing the Environment with Closures</h3></a>
<p>In the workout generator example, we only used closures as inline anonymous
functions. However, closures have an additional capability that functions don’t
have: they can capture their environment and access variables from the scope in
which they’re defined.</p>
<p>Listing 13-12 has an example of a closure stored in the variable <code>equal_to_x</code>
that uses the variable <code>x</code> from the closure’s surrounding environment:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x = 4;

    let equal_to_x = |z| z == x;

    let y = 4;

    assert!(equal_to_x(y));
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-12: Example of a closure that refers to a
variable in its enclosing scope</span></p>
<p>Here, even though <code>x</code> is not one of the parameters of <code>equal_to_x</code>, the
<code>equal_to_x</code> closure is allowed to use the <code>x</code> variable that’s defined in the
same scope that <code>equal_to_x</code> is defined in.</p>
<p>We can’t do the same with functions; if we try with the following example, our
code won’t compile:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let x = 4;

    fn equal_to_x(z: i32) -&gt; bool { z == x }

    let y = 4;

    assert!(equal_to_x(y));
}
</code></pre>
<p>We get an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0434]: can't capture dynamic environment in a fn item; use the || { ...
} closure form instead
 --&gt; src/main.rs
  |
4 |     fn equal_to_x(z: i32) -&gt; bool { z == x }
  |                                          ^
</code></pre>
<p>The compiler even reminds us that this only works with closures!</p>
<p>When a closure captures a value from its environment, it uses memory to store
the values for use in the closure body. This use of memory is overhead that we
don’t want to pay in more common cases where we want to execute code that
doesn’t capture its environment. Because functions are never allowed to capture
their environment, defining and using functions will never incur this overhead.</p>
<p>Closures can capture values from their environment in three ways, which
directly map to the three ways a function can take a parameter: taking
ownership, borrowing immutably, and borrowing mutably. These are encoded in the
three <code>Fn</code> traits as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>FnOnce</code> consumes the variables it captures from its enclosing scope, known
as the closure’s <em>environment</em>. To consume the captured variables, the
closure must take ownership of these variables and move them into the closure
when it is defined. The <code>Once</code> part of the name represents the fact that the
closure can’t take ownership of the same variables more than once, so it can
only be called one time.</li>
<li><code>Fn</code> borrows values from the environment immutably.</li>
<li><code>FnMut</code> can change the environment because it mutably borrows values.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we create a closure, Rust infers which trait to use based on how the
closure uses the values from the environment. In Listing 13-12, the
<code>equal_to_x</code> closure borrows <code>x</code> immutably (so <code>equal_to_x</code> has the <code>Fn</code> trait)
because the body of the closure only needs to read the value in <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>If we want to force the closure to take ownership of the values it uses in the
environment, we can use the <code>move</code> keyword before the parameter list. This
technique is mostly useful when passing a closure to a new thread to move the
data so it’s owned by the new thread.</p>
<p>We’ll have more examples of <code>move</code> closures in Chapter 16 when we talk about
concurrency. For now, here’s the code from Listing 13-12 with the <code>move</code>
keyword added to the closure definition and using vectors instead of integers,
because integers can be copied rather than moved; note that this code will not
yet compile:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let x = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let equal_to_x = move |z| z == x;

    println!(&quot;can't use x here: {:?}&quot;, x);

    let y = vec![1, 2, 3];

    assert!(equal_to_x(y));
}
</code></pre>
<p>We receive the following error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0382]: use of moved value: `x`
 --&gt; src/main.rs:6:40
  |
4 |     let equal_to_x = move |z| z == x;

  |
  = note: move occurs because `x` has type `std::vec::Vec&lt;i32&gt;`, which does not
  implement the `Copy` trait
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>x</code> value is moved into the closure when the closure is defined, because we
added the <code>move</code> keyword. The closure then has ownership of <code>x</code>, and <code>main</code>
isn’t allowed to use <code>x</code> anymore in the <code>println!</code> statement. Removing
<code>println!</code> will fix this example.</p>
<p>Most of the time when specifying one of the <code>Fn</code> trait bounds, you can start
with <code>Fn</code> and the compiler will tell you if you need <code>FnMut</code> or <code>FnOnce</code> based
on what happens in the closure body.</p>
<p>To illustrate situations where closures that can capture their environment are
useful as function parameters, let’s move on to our next topic: iterators.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#processing-a-series-of-items-with-iterators" id="processing-a-series-of-items-with-iterators"><h2>Processing a Series of Items with Iterators</h2></a>
<p>The iterator pattern allows you to perform some task on a sequence of items in
turn. An <em>iterator</em> is responsible for the logic of iterating over each item
and determining when the sequence has finished. When we use iterators, we don’t
have to reimplement that logic ourselves.</p>
<p>In Rust, iterators are <em>lazy</em>, meaning they have no effect until we call
methods that consume the iterator to use it up. For example, the code in
Listing 13-13 creates an iterator over the items in the vector <code>v1</code> by calling
the <code>iter</code> method defined on <code>Vec</code>. This code by itself doesn’t do anything
useful:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

let v1_iter = v1.iter();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-13: Creating an iterator</span></p>
<p>Once we’ve created an iterator, we can use it in a variety of ways. In Listing
3-4 in Chapter 3, we used iterators with <code>for</code> loops to execute some code on
each item, although we glossed over what the call to <code>iter</code> did until now.</p>
<p>The example in Listing 13-14 separates the creation of the iterator from the
use of the iterator in the <code>for</code> loop. The iterator is stored in the <code>v1_iter</code>
variable, and no iteration takes place at that time. When the <code>for</code> loop is

<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-14: Making use of an iterator in a <code>for</code>
loop</span></p>
<p>In languages that don’t have iterators provided by their standard libraries, we
would likely write this same functionality by starting a variable at index 0,
using that variable to index into the vector to get a value, and incrementing
the variable value in a loop until it gets to the total number of items in the
vector.</p>
<p>Iterators handle all that logic for us, cutting down on repetitive code we
could potentially mess up. Iterators give us more flexibility to use the same
logic with many different kinds of sequences, not just data structures we can
index into, like vectors. Let’s examine how iterators do that.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-iterator-trait-and-the-next-method" id="the-iterator-trait-and-the-next-method"><h3>The <code>Iterator</code> Trait and the <code>next</code> Method</h3></a>
<p>All iterators implement a trait named <code>Iterator</code> that is defined in the
standard library. The definition of the trait looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;;

    // methods with default implementations elided
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Notice some new syntax that we haven’t covered yet: <code>type Item</code> and
<code>Self::Item</code>, which are defining an <em>associated type</em> with this trait. We’ll
talk about associated types in depth in Chapter 19. For now, all you need to
know is that this code says implementing the <code>Iterator</code> trait requires that you
also define an <code>Item</code> type, and this <code>Item</code> type is used in the return type of
the <code>next</code> method. In other words, the <code>Item</code> type will be the type returned
from the iterator.</p>
<p>The <code>Iterator</code> trait only requires implementors to define one method: the
<code>next</code> method, which returns one item of the iterator at a time wrapped in
<code>Some</code> and, when iteration is over, it returns <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>We can call the <code>next</code> method on iterators directly; Listing 13-15 demonstrates
what values are returned from repeated calls to <code>next</code> on the iterator created
from the vector:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust test_harness">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[test]
fn iterator_demonstration() {
    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let mut v1_iter = v1.iter();

    assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&amp;1));
    assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&amp;2));
    assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), Some(&amp;3));
    assert_eq!(v1_iter.next(), None);
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-15: Calling the <code>next</code> method on an
iterator</span></p>
<p>Note that we needed to make <code>v1_iter</code> mutable: calling the <code>next</code> method on an
iterator changes state that keeps track of where it is in the sequence. In
other words, this code <em>consumes</em>, or uses up, the iterator. Each call to
<code>next</code> eats up an item from the iterator. We didn’t need to make <code>v1_iter</code>
mutable when we used a <code>for</code> loop because the loop took ownership of <code>v1_iter</code>
and made it mutable behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Also note that the values we get from the calls to <code>next</code> are immutable
references to the values in the vector. The <code>iter</code> method produces an iterator
over immutable references. If we want to create an iterator that takes
ownership of <code>v1</code> and returns owned values, we can call <code>into_iter</code> instead of
<code>iter</code>. Similarly, if we want to iterate over mutable references, we can call
<code>iter_mut</code> instead of <code>iter</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#methods-that-consume-the-iterator" id="methods-that-consume-the-iterator"><h3>Methods that Consume the Iterator</h3></a>
<p>The <code>Iterator</code> trait has a number of different methods with default
implementations provided for us by the standard library; you can find out about
these methods by looking in the standard library API documentation for the
<code>Iterator</code> trait. Some of these methods call the <code>next</code> method in their
definition, which is why we’re required to implement the <code>next</code> method when
implementing the <code>Iterator</code> trait.</p>
<p>Methods that call <code>next</code> are called <em>consuming adaptors</em>, because calling them
uses up the iterator. One example is the <code>sum</code> method, which takes ownership of
the iterator and iterates through the items by repeatedly calling <code>next</code>, thus
consuming the iterator. As it iterates through, it adds each item to a running
total and returns the total when iteration is complete. Listing 13-16 has a
test illustrating a use of the <code>sum</code> method:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]

    let v1_iter = v1.iter();

    let total: i32 = v1_iter.sum();

    assert_eq!(total, 6);
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-16: Calling the <code>sum</code> method to get the total
of all items in the iterator</span></p>
<p>We aren’t allowed to use <code>v1_iter</code> after the call to <code>sum</code> because <code>sum</code> takes
ownership of the iterator we call it on.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#methods-that-produce-other-iterators" id="methods-that-produce-other-iterators"><h3>Methods that Produce Other Iterators</h3></a>
<p>Other methods defined on the <code>Iterator</code> trait, known as <em>iterator adaptors</em>,
allow us to change iterators into different kind of iterators. We can chain
multiple calls to iterator adaptors to perform complex actions in a readable
way. But because all iterators are lazy, we have to call one of the consuming
adaptor methods to get results from calls to iterator adaptors.</p>
<p>Listing 13-17 shows an example of calling the iterator adaptor method <code>map</code>,
which takes a closure to call on each item to produce a new iterator. The
closure here creates a new iterator in which each item from the vector has been
incremented by 1. However, this code produces a warning:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let v1: Vec&lt;i32&gt; = vec![1, 2, 3];

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-17: Calling the iterator adaptor <code>map</code> to

<p>The warning we get is:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The code in Listing 13-17 doesn’t do anything; the closure we’ve specified
never gets called. The warning reminds us why: iterator adaptors are lazy, and
we need to consume the iterator here.</p>
<p>To fix this and consume the iterator, we’ll use the <code>collect</code> method, which you
saw briefly in Chapter 12. This method consumes the iterator and collects the
resulting values into a collection data type.</p>
<p>In Listing 13-18, we collect the results of iterating over the iterator that’s
returned from the call to <code>map</code> into a vector. This vector will end up
containing each item from the original vector incremented by 1:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let v1: Vec&lt;i32&gt; = vec![1, 2, 3];

let v2: Vec&lt;_&gt; = v1.iter().map(|x| x + 1).collect();

assert_eq!(v2, vec![2, 3, 4]);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-18: Calling the <code>map</code> method to create a new
iterator, and then calling the <code>collect</code> method to consume the new iterator and
create a vector</span></p>
<p>Because <code>map</code> takes a closure, we can specify any operation we want to perform
on each item. This is a great example of how closures let us customize some
behavior while reusing the iteration behavior that the <code>Iterator</code> trait
provides.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-closures-that-capture-their-environment" id="using-closures-that-capture-their-environment"><h3>Using Closures that Capture Their Environment</h3></a>
<p>Now that we’ve introduced iterators, we can demonstrate a common use of
closures that capture their environment by using the <code>filter</code> iterator adaptor.
The <code>filter</code> method on an iterator takes a closure that takes each item from
the iterator and returns a Boolean. If the closure returns <code>true</code>, the value
will be included in the iterator produced by <code>filter</code>. If the closure returns
<code>false</code>, the value won’t be included in the resulting iterator.</p>
<p>In Listing 13-19 we use <code>filter</code> with a closure that captures the <code>shoe_size</code>
variable from its environment to iterate over a collection of <code>Shoe</code> struct
instances. It will return only shoes that are the specified size:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-19: Using the <code>filter</code> method with a closure

<p>The <code>shoes_in_my_size</code> function takes ownership of a vector of shoes and a shoe

<p>In the body of <code>shoes_in_my_size</code>, we call <code>into_iter</code> to create an iterator
that takes ownership of the vector. Then we call <code>filter</code> to adapt that
iterator into a new iterator that only contains elements for which the closure
returns <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>The closure captures the <code>shoe_size</code> parameter from the environment and
compares the value with each shoe’s size, keeping only shoes of the size
specified. Finally, calling <code>collect</code> gathers the values returned by the

<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-our-own-iterators-with-iterator" id="creating-our-own-iterators-with-iterator"><h3>Creating Our Own Iterators with <code>Iterator</code></h3></a>
<p>We’ve shown that we can create an iterator by calling <code>iter</code>, <code>into_iter</code>, or
<code>iter_mut</code> on a vector. We can create iterators from the other collection types
in the standard library, such as hash map. We can also create iterators that do
anything we want by implementing the <code>Iterator</code> trait on our own types. As
previously mentioned, the only method we’re required to provide a definition
for is the <code>next</code> method. Once we’ve done that, we can use all other methods
that have default implementations provided by the <code>Iterator</code> trait!</p>
<p>To demonstrate, let’s create an iterator that will only ever count from 1 to 5.
First, we’ll create a struct to hold some values, and then we’ll make this
struct into an iterator by implementing the <code>Iterator</code> trait and use the values
in that implementation.</p>
<p>Listing 13-20 has the definition of the <code>Counter</code> struct and an associated
<code>new</code> function to create instances of <code>Counter</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
struct Counter {
    count: u32,
}

impl Counter {
    fn new() -&gt; Counter {
        Counter { count: 0 }
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-20: Defining the <code>Counter</code> struct and a <code>new</code>
function that creates instances of <code>Counter</code> with an initial value of 0 for
<code>count</code></span></p>
<p>The <code>Counter</code> struct has one field named <code>count</code>. This field holds a <code>u32</code>
value that will keep track of where we are in the process of iterating from 1
to 5. The <code>count</code> field is private because we want the implementation of
<code>Counter</code> to manage its value. The <code>new</code> function enforces the behavior of
always starting new instances with a value of 0 in the <code>count</code> field.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll implement the <code>Iterator</code> trait for our <code>Counter</code> type by defining
the body of the <code>next</code> method to specify what we want to happen when this
iterator is used, as shown in Listing 13-21:</p>

    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt; {
        self.count += 1;

        if self.count &lt; 6 {
            Some(self.count)
        } else {

    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-21: Implementing the <code>Iterator</code> trait on our

<p>We set the associated <code>Item</code> type for our iterator to <code>u32</code>, meaning the
iterator will return <code>u32</code> values. Again, don’t worry about associated types
yet, we’ll cover them in Chapter 19.</p>
<p>We want our iterator to add one to the current state, so we initialized <code>count</code>
to 0 so it would return 1 first. If the value of <code>count</code> is less than 6, <code>next</code>
will return the current value wrapped in <code>Some</code>, but if <code>count</code> is 6 or higher,
our iterator will return <code>None</code>.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#removing-a-clone-using-an-iterator" id="removing-a-clone-using-an-iterator"><h3>Removing a <code>clone</code> Using an Iterator</h3></a>
<p>In Listing 12-6, we added code that took a slice of <code>String</code> values and created
an instance of the <code>Config</code> struct by indexing into the slice and cloning the
values, allowing the <code>Config</code> struct to own those values. In Listing 13-24,
we’ve reproduced the implementation of the <code>Config::new</code> function as it was in
Listing 12-23 at the end of Chapter 12:</p>

        }

        let query = args[1].clone();
        let filename = args[2].clone();

        let case_sensitive = env::var(&quot;CASE_INSENSITIVE&quot;).is_err();

    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-24: Reproduction of the <code>Config::new</code> function

<p>At the time, we said not to worry about the inefficient <code>clone</code> calls because
we would remove them in the future. Well, that time is now!</p>
<p>We needed <code>clone</code> here because we have a slice with <code>String</code> elements in the
parameter <code>args</code>, but the <code>new</code> function doesn’t own <code>args</code>. To return
ownership of a <code>Config</code> instance, we had to clone the values from the <code>query</code>
and <code>filename</code> fields of <code>Config</code> so the <code>Config</code> instance can own its values.</p>
<p>With our new knowledge about iterators, we can change the <code>new</code> function to
take ownership of an iterator as its argument instead of borrowing a slice.
We’ll use the iterator functionality instead of the code that checks the length
of the slice and indexes into specific locations. This will clarify what the
<code>Config::new</code> function is doing because the iterator will access the values.</p>
<p>Once <code>Config::new</code> takes ownership of the iterator and stops using indexing
operations that borrow, we can move the <code>String</code> values from the iterator into
<code>Config</code> rather than calling <code>clone</code> and making a new allocation.</p>

<code>args</code> and we’ll be mutating <code>args</code> by iterating over it, we can add the <code>mut</code>
keyword into the specification of the <code>args</code> parameter to make it mutable.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-iterator-trait-methods-instead-of-indexing" id="using-iterator-trait-methods-instead-of-indexing"><h4>Using <code>Iterator</code> Trait Methods Instead of Indexing</h4></a>
<p>Next, we’ll fix the body of <code>Config::new</code>. The standard library documentation
also mentions that <code>std::env::Args</code> implements the <code>Iterator</code> trait, so we know
we can call the <code>next</code> method on it! Listing 13-27 updates the code from
Listing 12-23 to use the <code>next</code> method:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# use std::env;
#
# struct Config {
#     query: String,
#     filename: String,
#     case_sensitive: bool,
# }
#
impl Config {
    pub fn new(mut args: std::env::Args) -&gt; Result&lt;Config, &amp;'static str&gt; {
        args.next();

        let query = match args.next() {
            Some(arg) =&gt; arg,
            None =&gt; return Err(&quot;Didn't get a query string&quot;),
        };

        let filename = match args.next() {
            Some(arg) =&gt; arg,
            None =&gt; return Err(&quot;Didn't get a file name&quot;),
        };

        let case_sensitive = env::var(&quot;CASE_INSENSITIVE&quot;).is_err();

        Ok(Config { query, filename, case_sensitive })
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-27: Changing the body of <code>Config::new</code> to use
iterator methods</span></p>
<p>Remember that the first value in the return value of <code>env::args</code> is the name of
the program. We want to ignore that and get to the next value, so first we call
<code>next</code> and do nothing with the return value. Second, we call <code>next</code> on the
value we want to put in the <code>query</code> field of <code>Config</code>. If <code>next</code> returns a
<code>Some</code>, we use a <code>match</code> to extract the value. If it returns <code>None</code>, it means
not enough arguments were given and we return early with an <code>Err</code> value. We do
the same thing for the <code>filename</code> value.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#making-code-clearer-with-iterator-adaptors" id="making-code-clearer-with-iterator-adaptors"><h3>Making Code Clearer with Iterator Adaptors</h3></a>
<p>We can also take advantage of iterators in the <code>search</code> function in our I/O
project, which is reproduced here in Listing 13-28 as it was in Listing 12-19
at the end of Chapter 12:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn search&lt;'a&gt;(query: &amp;str, contents: &amp;'a str) -&gt; Vec&lt;&amp;'a str&gt; {
    let mut results = Vec::new();

    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.contains(query) {
            results.push(line);
        }
    }

    results
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-28: The implementation of the <code>search</code>
function from Chapter 12</span></p>
<p>We can write this code in a more concise way using iterator adaptor methods.
Doing so also lets us avoid having a mutable intermediate <code>results</code> vector. The
functional programming style prefers to minimize the amount of mutable state to
make code clearer. Removing the mutable state might make it easier for us to
make a future enhancement to make searching happen in parallel, because we
wouldn’t have to manage concurrent access to the <code>results</code> vector. Listing
13-29 shows this change:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn search&lt;'a&gt;(query: &amp;str, contents: &amp;'a str) -&gt; Vec&lt;&amp;'a str&gt; {
    contents.lines()
        .filter(|line| line.contains(query))
        .collect()
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 13-29: Using iterator adaptor methods in the
implementation of the <code>search</code> function</span></p>
<p>Recall that the purpose of the <code>search</code> function is to return all lines in
<code>contents</code> that contain the <code>query</code>. Similar to the <code>filter</code> example in Listing
13-19, we can use the <code>filter</code> adaptor to keep only the lines that
<code>line.contains(query)</code> returns true for. We then collect the matching lines
into another vector with <code>collect</code>. Much simpler! Feel free to make the same
change to use iterator methods in the <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function as
well.</p>
<p>The next logical question is which style you should choose in your own code and
why: the original implementation in Listing 13-28 or the version using
iterators in Listing 13-29. Most Rust programmers prefer to use the iterator
style. It’s a bit tougher to get the hang of at first, but once you get a feel
for the various iterator adaptors and what they do, iterators can be easier to
understand. Instead of fiddling with the various bits of looping and building
new vectors, the code focuses on the high-level objective of the loop. This
abstracts away some of the commonplace code so it’s easier to see the concepts
that are unique to this code, such as the filtering condition each element in
the iterator must pass.</p>
<p>But are the two implementations truly equivalent? The intuitive assumption
might be that the more low-level loop will be faster. Let’s talk about
performance.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#comparing-performance-loops-vs-iterators" id="comparing-performance-loops-vs-iterators"><h2>Comparing Performance: Loops vs. Iterators</h2></a>
<p>To determine whether to use loops or iterators, we need to know which version
of our <code>search</code> functions is faster: the version with an explicit <code>for</code> loop or
the version with iterators.</p>
<p>We ran a benchmark by loading the entire contents of <em>The Adventures of
Sherlock Holmes</em> by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle into a <code>String</code> and looking for the
word “the” in the contents. Here are the results of the benchmark on the
version of <code>search</code> using the <code>for</code> loop and the version using iterators:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">test bench_search_for  ... bench:  19,620,300 ns/iter (+/- 915,700)
test bench_search_iter ... bench:  19,234,900 ns/iter (+/- 657,200)
</code></pre>
<p>The iterator version was slightly faster! We won’t explain the benchmark code
here, because the point is not to prove that the two versions are equivalent
but to get a general sense of how these two implementations compare
performance-wise.</p>
<p>For a more comprehensive benchmark, you should check various texts of various
sizes, different words, words of different lengths, and all kinds of other
variations. The point is this: iterators, although a high-level abstraction,
get compiled down to roughly the same code as if you’d written the lower-level
code yourself. Iterators are one of Rust’s <em>zero-cost</em> <em>abstractions</em>, by which
we mean using the abstraction imposes no additional runtime overhead in the
same way that Bjarne Stroustrup, the original designer and implementor of C++,
defines <em>zero-overhead</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, C++ implementations obey the zero-overhead principle: What you
don’t use, you don’t pay for. And further: What you do use, you couldn’t hand
code any better.</p>
<p>Bjarne Stroustrup’s “Foundations of C++”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As another example, the following code is taken from an audio decoder. The
decoding algorithm uses the linear prediction mathematical operation to
estimate future values based on a linear function of the previous samples. This
code uses an iterator chain to do some math on three variables in scope: a
<code>buffer</code> slice of data, an array of 12 <code>coefficients</code>, and an amount by which
to shift data in <code>qlp_shift</code>. We’ve declared the variables within this example
but not given them any values; although this code doesn’t have much meaning
outside of its context, it’s still a concise, real-world example of how Rust
translates high-level ideas to low-level code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let buffer: &amp;mut [i32];
let coefficients: [i64; 12];
let qlp_shift: i16;

for i in 12..buffer.len() {
    let prediction = coefficients.iter()
                                 .zip(&amp;buffer[i - 12..i])
                                 .map(|(&amp;c, &amp;s)| c * s as i64)
                                 .sum::&lt;i64&gt;() &gt;&gt; qlp_shift;
    let delta = buffer[i];
    buffer[i] = prediction as i32 + delta;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To calculate the value of <code>prediction</code>, this code iterates through each of the
12 values in <code>coefficients</code> and uses the <code>zip</code> method to pair the coefficient
values with the previous 12 values in <code>buffer</code>. Then, for each pair, we
multiply the values together, sum all the results, and shift the bits in the
sum <code>qlp_shift</code> bits to the right.</p>
<p>Calculations in applications like audio decoders often prioritize performance
most highly. Here, we’re creating an iterator, using two adaptors, and then
consuming the value. What assembly code would this Rust code compile to? Well,
as of this writing, it compiles down to the same assembly you’d write by hand.
There’s no loop at all corresponding to the iteration over the values in
<code>coefficients</code>: Rust knows that there are 12 iterations, so it “unrolls” the
loop. <em>Unrolling</em> is an optimization that removes the overhead of the loop
controlling code and instead generates repetitive code for each iteration of
the loop.</p>
<p>All of the coefficients get stored in registers, which means it’s very fast to
access the values. There are no bounds checks on the array access at runtime.
All these optimizations Rust is able to apply make the resulting code extremely
efficient. Now that you know this, you can use iterators and closures without
fear! They make code seem like it’s higher level but don’t impose a runtime
performance penalty for doing so.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#summary-11" id="summary-11"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>Closures and iterators are Rust features inspired by functional programming
language ideas. They contribute to Rust’s capability to clearly express
high-level ideas at low-level performance. The implementations of closures and
iterators are such that runtime performance is not affected. This is part of
Rust’s goal to strive to provide zero-cost abstractions.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve improved the expressiveness of our I/O project, let’s look at
some more features of <code>cargo</code> that will help us share the project with the
world.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#more-about-cargo-and-cratesio" id="more-about-cargo-and-cratesio"><h1>More about Cargo and Crates.io</h1></a>
<p>So far we’ve used only the most basic features of Cargo to build, run, and test
our code, but it can do a lot more. Here we’ll go over some of its other, more
advanced features to show you how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customize your build through release profiles</li>
<li>Publish libraries on crates.io</li>
<li>Organize larger projects with workspaces</li>
<li>Install binaries from crates.io</li>
<li>Extend Cargo with your own custom commands</li>
</ul>
<p>Cargo can do even more than what we can cover in this chapter too, so for a
full explanation, see <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">its documentation</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#customizing-builds-with-release-profiles" id="customizing-builds-with-release-profiles"><h2>Customizing Builds with Release Profiles</h2></a>
<p>In Rust <em>release profiles</em> are pre-defined, and customizable, profiles with
different configurations, to allow the programmer more control over various
options for compiling your code. Each profile is configured independently of
the others.</p>
<p>Cargo has two main profiles you should know about: the <code>dev</code> profile Cargo uses
when you run <code>cargo build</code>, and the <code>release</code> profile Cargo uses when you run
<code>cargo build --release</code>. The <code>dev</code> profile is defined with good defaults for
developing, and likewise the <code>release</code> profile has good defaults for release
builds.</p>
<p>These names may be familiar from the output of your builds, which shows the
profile used in the build:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
$ cargo build --release
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.0 secs
</code></pre>
<p>The “dev” and “release” notifications here indicate that the compiler is using
different profiles.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#customizing-release-profiles" id="customizing-release-profiles"><h3>Customizing Release Profiles</h3></a>
<p>Cargo has default settings for each of the profiles that apply when there
aren’t any <code>[profile.*]</code> sections in the project’s <em>Cargo.toml</em> file. By adding
<code>[profile.*]</code> sections for any profile we want to customize, we can choose to
override any subset of the default settings. For example, here are the default
values for the <code>opt-level</code> setting for the <code>dev</code> and <code>release</code> profiles:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[profile.dev]
opt-level = 0

[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>opt-level</code> setting controls how many optimizations Rust will apply to your
code, with a range of zero to three. Applying more optimizations makes
compilation take longer, so if you’re in development and compiling very often,
you’d want compiling to be fast at the expense of the resulting code running
slower. That’s why the default <code>opt-level</code> for <code>dev</code> is <code>0</code>. When you’re ready
to release, it’s better to spend more time compiling. You’ll only be compiling
in release mode once, and running the compiled program many times, so release
mode trades longer compile time for code that runs faster. That’s why the
default <code>opt-level</code> for the <code>release</code> profile is <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>We can choose to override any default setting by adding a different value for
them in <em>Cargo.toml</em>. If we wanted to use optimization level 1 in the
development profile, for example, we can add these two lines to our project’s
<em>Cargo.toml</em>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[profile.dev]
opt-level = 1
</code></pre>
<p>This overrides the default setting of <code>0</code>. Now when we run <code>cargo build</code>, Cargo
will use the defaults for the <code>dev</code> profile plus our customization to
<code>opt-level</code>. Because we set <code>opt-level</code> to <code>1</code>, Cargo will apply more
optimizations than the default, but not as many as a release build.</p>
<p>For the full list of configuration options and defaults for each profile, see
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">Cargo’s documentation</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#publishing-a-crate-to-cratesio" id="publishing-a-crate-to-cratesio"><h2>Publishing a Crate to Crates.io</h2></a>
<p>We’ve used packages from crates.io as dependencies of our project, but you can
also share your code for other people to use by publishing your own packages.
Crates.io distributes the source code of your packages, so it primarily hosts
code that’s open source.</p>
<p>Rust and Cargo have features that help make your published package easier for
people to find and use. We’ll talk about some of those features, then cover how
to publish a package.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#making-useful-documentation-comments" id="making-useful-documentation-comments"><h3>Making Useful Documentation Comments</h3></a>
<p>Accurately documenting your packages will help other users know how and when to
use them, so it’s worth spending some time to write documentation. In Chapter
3, we discussed how to comment Rust code with <code>//</code>. Rust also has particular
kind of comment for documentation, known conveniently as <em>documentation
comments</em>, that will generate HTML documentation. The HTML displays the
contents of documentation comments for public API items, intended for
programmers interested in knowing how to <em>use</em> your crate, as opposed to how
your crate is <em>implemented</em>.</p>
<p>Documentation comments use <code>///</code> instead of <code>//</code> and support Markdown notation
for formatting the text if you’d like. You place documentation comments just
before the item they are documenting. Listing 14-1 shows documentation comments
for an <code>add_one</code> function in a crate named <code>my_crate</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">/// Adds one to the number given.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let five = 5;
///
/// assert_eq!(6, my_crate::add_one(5));
/// ```
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    x + 1
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 14-1: A documentation comment for a
function</span></p>
<p>Here, we give a description of what the <code>add_one</code> function does, then start a
section with the heading “Examples”, and code that demonstrates how to use the
<code>add_one</code> function. We can generate the HTML documentation from this
documentation comment by running <code>cargo doc</code>. This command runs the <code>rustdoc</code>
tool distributed with Rust and puts the generated HTML documentation in the
<em>target/doc</em> directory.</p>
<p>For convenience, running <code>cargo doc --open</code> will build the HTML for your
current crate’s documentation (as well as the documentation for all of your
crate’s dependencies) and open the result in a web browser. Navigate to the
<code>add_one</code> function and you’ll see how the text in the documentation comments
gets rendered, shown here in Figure 14-2:</p>
<p><img alt="Rendered HTML documentation for the `add_one` function of `my_crate`" src="img/trpl14-03.png" class="center" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 14-2: HTML documentation for the <code>add_one</code>
function</span></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#commonly-used-sections" id="commonly-used-sections"><h4>Commonly Used Sections</h4></a>
<p>We used the <code># Examples</code> markdown heading in Listing 14-1 to create a section
in the HTML with the title “Examples”. Some other sections that crate authors
commonly use in their documentation include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Panics</strong>: The scenarios in which this function could <code>panic!</code>. Callers of
this function who don’t want their programs to panic should make sure that
they don’t call this function in these situations.</li>
<li><strong>Errors</strong>: If this function returns a <code>Result</code>, describing the kinds of
errors that might occur and what conditions might cause those errors to be
returned can be helpful to callers so that they can write code to handle the
different kinds of errors in different ways.</li>
<li><strong>Safety</strong>: If this function is <code>unsafe</code> to call (we will discuss unsafety in
Chapter 19), there should be a section explaining why the function is unsafe
and covering the invariants that this function expects callers to uphold.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most documentation comment sections don’t need all of these sections, but this
is a good list to check to remind you of the kinds of things that people
calling your code will be interested in knowing about.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#documentation-comments-as-tests" id="documentation-comments-as-tests"><h4>Documentation Comments as Tests</h4></a>
<p>Adding examples in code blocks in your documentation comments is a way to
clearly demonstrate how to use your library, but it has an additional bonus:
running <code>cargo test</code> will run the code examples in your documentation as tests!
Nothing is better than documentation with examples. Nothing is worse than
examples that don’t actually work because the code has changed since the
documentation has been written. Try running <code>cargo test</code> with the documentation
for the <code>add_one</code> function like in Listing 14-1; you should see a section in
the test results like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">   Doc-tests my_crate

running 1 test
test src/lib.rs - add_one (line 5) ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
</code></pre>
<p>Now try changing either the function or the example so that the <code>assert_eq!</code> in
the example will panic. Run <code>cargo test</code> again, and you’ll see that the doc
tests catch that the example and the code are out of sync from one another!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#commenting-contained-items" id="commenting-contained-items"><h4>Commenting Contained Items</h4></a>
<p>There’s another style of doc comment, <code>//!</code>, that adds documentation to the
item that contains the comments, rather than adding documentation to the items
following the comments. These are typically used inside the crate root file
(<em>src/lib.rs</em> by convention) or inside a module to document the crate or the
module as a whole.</p>
<p>For example, if we wanted to add documentation that described the purpose of
the <code>my_crate</code> crate that contains the <code>add_one</code> function, we can add
documentation comments that start with <code>//!</code> to the beginning of <em>src/lib.rs</em>
as shown in Listing 14-3:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">//! # My Crate
//!
//! `my_crate` is a collection of utilities to make performing certain
//! calculations more convenient.

/// Adds one to the number given.
// --snip--
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 14-3: Documentation for the <code>my_crate</code> crate as a
whole</span></p>
<p>Notice there isn’t any code after the last line that begins with <code>//!</code>. Because
we started the comments with <code>//!</code> instead of <code>///</code>, we’re documenting the item
that contains this comment rather than an item that follows this comment. In
this case, the item that contains this comment is the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file, which
is the crate root. These comments describe the entire crate.</p>
<p>If we run <code>cargo doc --open</code>, we’ll see these comments displayed on the front
page of the documentation for <code>my_crate</code> above the list of public items in the
crate, as shown in Figure 14-4:</p>
<p><img alt="Rendered HTML documentation with a comment for the crate as a whole" src="img/trpl14-05.png" class="center" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 14-4: Rendered documentation for <code>my_crate</code>
including the comment describing the crate as a whole</span></p>
<p>Documentation comments within items are useful for describing crates and
modules especially. Use them to talk about the purpose of the container overall
to help users of your crate understand your organization.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#exporting-a-convenient-public-api-with-pub-use" id="exporting-a-convenient-public-api-with-pub-use"><h4>Exporting a Convenient Public API with <code>pub use</code></h4></a>
<p>In Chapter 7, we covered how to organize our code into modules with the <code>mod</code>
keyword, how to make items public with the <code>pub</code> keyword, and how to bring
items into a scope with the <code>use</code> keyword. The structure that makes sense to
you while you’re developing a crate may not be very convenient for your users,
however. You may wish to organize your structs in a hierarchy containing
multiple levels, but people that want to use a type you’ve defined deep in the
hierarchy might have trouble finding out that those types exist. They might
also be annoyed at having to type <code>use my_crate::some_module::another_module::UsefulType;</code> rather than <code>use my_crate::UsefulType;</code>.</p>
<p>The structure of your public API is a major consideration when publishing a
crate. People who use your crate are less familiar with the structure than you
are, and might have trouble finding the pieces they want to use if the module
hierarchy is large.</p>
<p>The good news is that, if the structure <em>isn’t</em> convenient for others to use
from another library, you don’t have to rearrange your internal organization:
you can choose to re-export items to make a public structure that’s different
to your private structure, using <code>pub use</code>. Re-exporting takes a public item in
one location and makes it public in another location as if it was defined in
the other location instead.</p>
<p>For example, say we made a library named <code>art</code> for modeling artistic concepts.
Within this library is a <code>kinds</code> module containing two enums named
<code>PrimaryColor</code> and <code>SecondaryColor</code> and a <code>utils</code> module containing a function
named <code>mix</code> as shown in Listing 14-5:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">//! # Art
//!
//! A library for modeling artistic concepts.

pub mod kinds {
    /// The primary colors according to the RYB color model.
    pub enum PrimaryColor {
        Red,
        Yellow,
        Blue,
    }

    /// The secondary colors according to the RYB color model.
    pub enum SecondaryColor {
        Orange,
        Green,
        Purple,
    }
}

pub mod utils {
    use kinds::*;

    /// Combines two primary colors in equal amounts to create
    /// a secondary color.
    pub fn mix(c1: PrimaryColor, c2: PrimaryColor) -&gt; SecondaryColor {
        // --snip--
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 14-5: An <code>art</code> library with items organized into
<code>kinds</code> and <code>utils</code> modules</span></p>
<p>The front page of the documentation for this crate generated by <code>cargo doc</code>
would look like Figure 14-6:</p>
<p><img alt="Rendered documentation for the `art` crate that lists the `kinds` and `utils` modules" src="img/trpl14-07.png" class="center" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 14-6: Front page of the documentation for <code>art</code>
that lists the <code>kinds</code> and <code>utils</code> modules</span></p>
<p>Note that the <code>PrimaryColor</code> and <code>SecondaryColor</code> types aren’t listed on the
front page, nor is the <code>mix</code> function. We have to click on <code>kinds</code> and <code>utils</code>
in order to see them.</p>
<p>Another crate depending on this library would need <code>use</code> statements that import
the items from <code>art</code> including specifying the module structure that’s currently
defined. Listing 14-7 shows an example of a crate that uses the <code>PrimaryColor</code>
and <code>mix</code> items from the <code>art</code> crate:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate art;

use art::kinds::PrimaryColor;
use art::utils::mix;

fn main() {
    let red = PrimaryColor::Red;
    let yellow = PrimaryColor::Yellow;
    mix(red, yellow);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 14-7: A crate using the <code>art</code> crate’s items with
its internal structure exported</span></p>
<p>The author of the code in Listing 14-7 that uses the <code>art</code> crate had to figure
out that <code>PrimaryColor</code> is in the <code>kinds</code> module and <code>mix</code> is in the <code>utils</code>
module. The module structure of the <code>art</code> crate is more relevant to developers
working on the <code>art</code> crate than developers using the <code>art</code> crate. The internal
structure that organizes parts of the crate into the <code>kinds</code> module and the
<code>utils</code> module doesn’t add any useful information to someone trying to
understand how to use the <code>art</code> crate. The <code>art</code> crate’s module structure adds
confusion in having to figure out where to look and inconvenience in having to
specify the module names in the <code>use</code> statements.</p>
<p>To remove the internal organization from the public API, we can take the <code>art</code>
crate code from Listing 14-5 and add <code>pub use</code> statements to re-export the
items at the top level, as shown in Listing 14-8:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">//! # Art
//!
//! A library for modeling artistic concepts.

pub use kinds::PrimaryColor;
pub use kinds::SecondaryColor;
pub use utils::mix;

pub mod kinds {
    // --snip--
}

pub mod utils {
    // --snip--
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 14-8: Adding <code>pub use</code> statements to re-export
items</span></p>
<p>The API documentation generated with <code>cargo doc</code> for this crate will now list
and link re-exports on the front page as shown in Figure 14-9, which makes
these types easier to find.</p>
<p><img alt="Rendered documentation for the `art` crate with the re-exports on the front page" src="img/trpl14-10.png" class="center" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 14-9: Front page of the documentation for <code>art</code>
that lists the re-exports</span></p>
<p>Users of the <code>art</code> crate can still see and choose to use the internal structure
as in Listing 14-7, or they can use the more convenient structure from Listing
14-8, as shown in Listing 14-10:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate art;

use art::PrimaryColor;
use art::mix;

fn main() {
    // --snip--
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 14-10: A program using the re-exported items from
the <code>art</code> crate</span></p>
<p>In cases where there are many nested modules, re-exporting the types at the top
level with <code>pub use</code> can make a big difference in the experience of people who
use the crate.</p>
<p>Creating a useful public API structure is more of an art than a science, and
you can iterate to find the API that works best for your users. Choosing <code>pub use</code> gives you flexibility in how you structure your crate internally, and
decouples that internal structure with what you present to your users. Take a
look at some of the code of crates you’ve installed to see if their internal
structure differs from their public API.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#setting-up-a-cratesio-account" id="setting-up-a-cratesio-account"><h3>Setting up a Crates.io Account</h3></a>
<p>Before you can publish any crates, you need to create an account on crates.io
and get an API token. To do so, visit the home page at <em>https://crates.io</em> and
log in via a GitHub account—the GitHub account is a requirement for now, but
the site may support other ways of creating an account in the future. Once
you’re logged in, visit your account settings at <em>https://crates.io/me</em> and
retrieve your API key. Then run the <code>cargo login</code> command with your API key,
like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo login abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345
</code></pre>
<p>This command will inform Cargo of your API token and store it locally in
<em>~/.cargo/credentials</em>. Note that this token is a <em>secret</em> and should not be
shared with anyone else. If it is shared with anyone for any reason, you should
revoke it and generate a new token on Crates.io.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#before-publishing-a-new-crate" id="before-publishing-a-new-crate"><h3>Before Publishing a New Crate</h3></a>
<p>Now you have an account, and let’s say you already have a crate you want to
publish. Before publishing, you’ll need to add some metadata to your crate by
adding it to the <code>[package]</code> section of the crate’s <em>Cargo.toml</em>.</p>
<p>Your crate will first need a unique name. While you’re working on a crate
locally, you may name a crate whatever you’d like. However, crate names on
Crates.io are allocated on a first-come-first-serve basis. Once a crate name is
taken, no one else may publish a crate with that name. Search for the name
you’d like to use on the site to find out if it has been taken. If it hasn’t,
edit the name in <em>Cargo.toml</em> under <code>[package]</code> to have the name you want to
use for publishing like so:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;guessing_game&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Even if you’ve chosen a unique name, if you try to run <code>cargo publish</code> to
publish the crate at this point, you’ll get a warning and then an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo publish
    Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
warning: manifest has no description, license, license-file, documentation,
homepage or repository.
--snip--
error: api errors: missing or empty metadata fields: description, license.
</code></pre>
<p>This is because we’re missing some crucial information: a description and
license are required so that people will know what your crate does and under
what terms they may use it. To rectify this error, we need to include this
information in <em>Cargo.toml</em>.</p>
<p>Make a description that’s just a sentence or two, as it will appear with your
crate in search results and on your crate’s page. For the <code>license</code> field, you
need to give a <em>license identifier value</em>. The Linux Foundation’s Software
Package Data Exchange (SPDX) at <em>http://spdx.org/licenses/</em> lists the
identifiers you can use for this value. For example, to specify that you’ve
licensed your crate using the MIT License, add the <code>MIT</code> identifier:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;guessing_game&quot;
license = &quot;MIT&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to use a license that doesn’t appear in the SPDX, you need to place
the text of that license in a file, include the file in your project, then use
<code>license-file</code> to specify the name of that file instead of using the <code>license</code>
key.</p>
<p>Guidance on which license is right for your project is out of scope for this
book. Many people in the Rust community choose to license their projects in the
same way as Rust itself, with a dual license of <code>MIT/Apache-2.0</code>—this
demonstrates that you can also specify multiple license identifiers separated
by a slash.</p>
<p>So, with a unique name, the version, and author details that <code>cargo new</code> added
when you created the crate, your description, and the license you chose added,
the <em>Cargo.toml</em> for a project that’s ready to publish might look like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;guessing_game&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
authors = [&quot;Your Name &lt;you@example.com&gt;&quot;]
description = &quot;A fun game where you guess what number the computer has chosen.&quot;
license = &quot;MIT/Apache-2.0&quot;

[dependencies]
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">Cargo’s documentation</a> describes other
metadata you can specify to ensure your crate can be discovered and used more
easily!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#publishing-to-cratesio" id="publishing-to-cratesio"><h3>Publishing to Crates.io</h3></a>
<p>Now that you’ve created an account, saved your API token, chosen a name for
your crate, and specified the required metadata, you’re ready to publish!
Publishing a crate uploads a specific version to crates.io for others to use.</p>
<p>Take care when publishing a crate, because a publish is <em>permanent</em>. The
version can never be overwritten, and the code cannot be deleted. One major
goal of Crates.io is to act as a permanent archive of code so that builds of
all projects that depend on crates from Crates.io will continue to work.
Allowing deletion of versions would make fulfilling that goal impossible.
However, there is no limit to the number of versions of a crate you can publish.</p>
<p>Let’s run the <code>cargo publish</code> command again. It should succeed now:</p>

<p>When you’ve made changes to your crate and are ready to release a new version,
you change the <code>version</code> value specified in your <em>Cargo.toml</em> and republish.

version number is based on the kinds of changes you’ve made. Then run <code>cargo publish</code> to upload the new version.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#removing-versions-from-cratesio-with-cargo-yank" id="removing-versions-from-cratesio-with-cargo-yank"><h3>Removing Versions from Crates.io with <code>cargo yank</code></h3></a>
<p>While you can’t remove previous versions of a crate, you can prevent any future
projects from adding them as a new dependency. This is useful when a version of
a crate ends up being broken for one reason or another. For situations such as
this, Cargo supports <em>yanking</em> a version of a crate.</p>
<p>Yanking a version prevents new projects from starting to depend on that version
while allowing all existing projects that depend on it to continue to download
and depend on that version. Essentially, a yank means that all projects with a
<em>Cargo.lock</em> will not break, while any future <em>Cargo.lock</em> files generated will
not use the yanked version.</p>
<p>To yank a version of a crate, run <code>cargo yank</code> and specify which version you
want to yank:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1
</code></pre>
<p>You can also undo a yank, and allow projects to start depending on a version
again, by adding <code>--undo</code> to the command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1 --undo
</code></pre>
<p>A yank <em>does not</em> delete any code. The yank feature is not intended for
deleting accidentally uploaded secrets, for example. If that happens, you must
reset those secrets immediately.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#cargo-workspaces" id="cargo-workspaces"><h2>Cargo Workspaces</h2></a>
<p>In Chapter 12, we built a package that included both a binary crate and a
library crate. You may find, as your project develops, that the library crate
continues to get bigger and you want to split your package up further into
multiple library crates. In this situation, Cargo has a feature called
<em>workspaces</em> that can help manage multiple related packages that are developed
in tandem.</p>
<p>A <em>workspace</em> is a set of packages that will all share the same <em>Cargo.lock</em>
and output directory. Let’s make a project using a workspace, using trivial
code so we can concentrate on the structure of a workspace. We’ll have a binary
that uses two libraries: one library that will provide an <code>add_one</code> function
and a second library that will provide an <code>add_two</code> function. These three
crates will all be part of the same workspace. We’ll start by creating a new
crate for the binary:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo new --bin adder
     Created binary (application) `adder` project
$ cd adder
</code></pre>
<p>We need to modify the binary package’s <em>Cargo.toml</em> and add a <code>[workspace]</code>
section to tell Cargo the <code>adder</code> package is a workspace. Add this at the
bottom of the file:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[workspace]
</code></pre>
<p>Like many Cargo features, workspaces support convention over configuration: we
don’t need to add anything more than this to <em>Cargo.toml</em> to define our
workspace as long as we follow the convention.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#specifying-workspace-dependencies" id="specifying-workspace-dependencies"><h3>Specifying Workspace Dependencies</h3></a>
<p>By default, Cargo will include all transitive path dependencies. A <em>path
dependency</em> is when any crate, whether in a workspace or not, specifies that it
has a dependency on a crate in a local directory by using the <code>path</code> attribute
on the dependency specification in <em>Cargo.toml</em>. If a crate has the
<code>[workspace]</code> key, or if the crate is itself part of a workspace, and we
specify path dependencies where the paths are subdirectories of the crate’s
directory, those dependent crates will be considered part of the workspace.
Let’s specify in the <em>Cargo.toml</em> for the top-level <code>adder</code> crate that it will
have a dependency on an <code>add-one</code> crate that will be in the <code>add-one</code>
subdirectory, by changing <em>Cargo.toml</em> to look like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
add-one = { path = &quot;add-one&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>If we add dependencies to <em>Cargo.toml</em> that don’t have a <code>path</code> specified,
those dependencies will be normal dependencies that aren’t in this workspace
and are assumed to come from Crates.io.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-the-second-crate-in-the-workspace" id="creating-the-second-crate-in-the-workspace"><h3>Creating the Second Crate in the Workspace</h3></a>
<p>Next, while in the <code>adder</code> directory, generate an <code>add-one</code> crate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo new add-one
     Created library `add-one` project
</code></pre>
<p>Your <code>adder</code> directory should now have these directories and files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">├── Cargo.toml
├── add-one
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── lib.rs
└── src
    └── main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>In <em>add-one/src/lib.rs</em>, let’s add an <code>add_one</code> function:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: add-one/src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    x + 1
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Open up <em>src/main.rs</em> for <code>adder</code> and add an <code>extern crate</code> line at the top of
the file to bring the new <code>add-one</code> library crate into scope. Then change the
<code>main</code> function to call the <code>add_one</code> function, as in Listing 14-11:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate add_one;

fn main() {
    let num = 10;
    println!(&quot;Hello, world! {} plus one is {}!&quot;, num, add_one::add_one(num));
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 14-11: Using the <code>add-one</code> library crate from the
<code>adder</code> crate</span></p>
<p>Let’s build the <code>adder</code> crate by running <code>cargo build</code> in the <em>adder</em> directory!</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build
   Compiling add-one v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder/add-one)
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.68 secs
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this builds both the <code>adder</code> crate and the <code>add-one</code> crate in
<em>adder/add-one</em>. Now your <em>adder</em> directory should have these files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── add-one
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── lib.rs
├── src
│   └── main.rs
└── target
</code></pre>
<p>The workspace has one <em>target</em> directory at the top level; <em>add-one</em> doesn’t
have its own <em>target</em> directory. Even if we go into the <code>add-one</code> directory and
run <code>cargo build</code>, the compiled artifacts end up in <em>adder/target</em> rather than
<em>adder/add-one/target</em>. The crates in a workspace depend on each other. If each
crate had its own <em>target</em> directory, each crate in the workspace would have to
recompile each other crate in the workspace in order to have the artifacts in
its own <em>target</em> directory. By sharing one <em>target</em> directory, the crates in
the workspace can avoid rebuilding the other crates in the workspace more than
necessary.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#depending-on-an-external-crate-in-a-workspace" id="depending-on-an-external-crate-in-a-workspace"><h4>Depending on an External Crate in a Workspace</h4></a>
<p>Also notice the workspace only has one <em>Cargo.lock</em>, rather than having a
top-level <em>Cargo.lock</em> and <em>add-one/Cargo.lock</em>. This ensures that all crates
are using the same version of all dependencies. If we add the <code>rand</code> crate to
both <em>Cargo.toml</em> and <em>add-one/Cargo.toml</em>, Cargo will resolve both of those to
one version of <code>rand</code> and record that in the one <em>Cargo.lock</em>. Making all
crates in the workspace use the same dependencies means the crates in the
workspace will always be compatible with each other. Let’s try this out now.</p>
<p>Let’s add the <code>rand</code> crate to the <code>[dependencies]</code> section in
<em>add-one/Cargo.toml</em> in order to be able to use the <code>rand</code> crate in the
<code>add-one</code> crate:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: add-one/Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]

rand = &quot;0.3.14&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>We can now add <code>extern crate rand;</code> to <em>add-one/src/lib.rs</em>, and building the
whole workspace by running <code>cargo build</code> in the <em>adder</em> directory will bring in
and compile the <code>rand</code> crate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build
    Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
 Downloading rand v0.3.14
   --snip--

   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 10.18 secs
</code></pre>
<p>The top level <em>Cargo.lock</em> now contains information about <code>add-one</code>’s
dependency on <code>rand</code>. However, even though <code>rand</code> is used somewhere in the
workspace, we can’t use it in other crates in the workspace unless we add
<code>rand</code> to their <em>Cargo.toml</em> as well. If we add <code>extern crate rand;</code> to
<em>src/main.rs</em> for the top level <code>adder</code> crate, for example, we’ll get an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo build
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
error[E0463]: can't find crate for `rand`
 --&gt; src/main.rs:1:1
  |
1 | extern crate rand;
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ can't find crate
</code></pre>
<p>To fix this, edit <em>Cargo.toml</em> for the top level <code>adder</code> crate and indicate
that <code>rand</code> is a dependency for that crate as well. Building the <code>adder</code> crate
will add <code>rand</code> to the list of dependencies for <code>adder</code> in <em>Cargo.lock</em>, but no
additional copies of <code>rand</code> will be downloaded. Cargo has ensured for us that
any crate in the workspace using the <code>rand</code> crate will be using the same
version. Using the same version of <code>rand</code> across the workspace saves space
since we won’t have multiple copies and ensures that the crates in the
workspace will be compatible with each other.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#adding-a-test-to-a-workspace" id="adding-a-test-to-a-workspace"><h4>Adding a Test to a Workspace</h4></a>
<p>For another enhancement, let’s add a test of the <code>add_one::add_one</code> function
within the <code>add_one</code> crate:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: add-one/src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    x + 1
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(3, add_one(2));
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Now run <code>cargo test</code> in the top-level <em>adder</em> directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo test

</code></pre>
<p>Wait a second, zero tests? We just added one! If we look at the output, we can
see that <code>cargo test</code> in a workspace only runs tests for the top level crate.
To run tests for all of the crates in the workspace, we need to pass the
<code>--all</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo test --all
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.37 secs

</code></pre>
<p>When passing <code>--all</code>, <code>cargo test</code> will run the tests for all of the crates in
the workspace. We can also choose to run tests for one particular crate in a
workspace from the top level directory by using the <code>-p</code> flag and specifying
the name of the crate we want to test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo test -p add-one
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs

   Doc-tests add-one

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre>
<p>This output shows <code>cargo test</code> only ran the tests for the <code>add-one</code> crate and
didn’t run the <code>adder</code> crate tests.</p>
<p>If you choose to publish the crates in the workspace to crates.io, each crate
in the workspace will get published separately. The <code>cargo publish</code> command
does not have an <code>--all</code> flag or a <code>-p</code> flag, so it is necessary to change to
each crate’s directory and run <code>cargo publish</code> on each crate in the workspace
in order to publish them.</p>
<p>Now try adding an <code>add-two</code> crate to this workspace in a similar way as the
<code>add-one</code> crate for some more practice!</p>
<p>As your project grows, consider using a workspace: smaller components are
easier to understand individually than one big blob of code. Keeping the crates
in a workspace can make coordination among them easier if they work together
and are often changed at the same time.</p>

<p>The <code>cargo install</code> command allows you to install and use binary crates
locally. This isn’t intended to replace system packages; it’s meant to be a
convenient way for Rust developers to install tools that others have shared on
crates.io. Only packages that have binary targets can be installed. A binary
target is the runnable program that gets created if the crate has a
<em>src/main.rs</em> or another file specified as a binary, as opposed to a library
target that isn’t runnable on its own but is suitable for including within
other programs. Usually, crates have information in the <em>README</em> file about
whether a crate is a library, has a binary target, or both.</p>
<p>All binaries from <code>cargo install</code> are put into the installation root’s <em>bin</em>
folder. If you installed Rust using <em>rustup.rs</em> and don’t have any custom
configurations, this will be <code>$HOME/.cargo/bin</code>. Ensure that directory is in
your <code>$PATH</code> to be able to run programs you’ve gotten through <code>cargo install</code>.</p>
<p>For example, we mentioned in Chapter 12 that there’s a Rust implementation of
the <code>grep</code> tool for searching files called <code>ripgrep</code>. If we want to install
<code>ripgrep</code>, we can run:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The last line of the output shows the location and the name of the installed
binary, which in the case of <code>ripgrep</code> is <code>rg</code>. As long as the installation
directory is in your <code>$PATH</code> as mentioned above, you can then run <code>rg --help</code>
and start using a faster, rustier tool for searching files!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#extending-cargo-with-custom-commands" id="extending-cargo-with-custom-commands"><h2>Extending Cargo with Custom Commands</h2></a>
<p>Cargo is designed so you can extend it with new subcommands without having to

you can run it as if it were a Cargo subcommand by running <code>cargo something</code>.
Custom commands like this are also listed when you run <code>cargo --list</code>. Being
able to <code>cargo install</code> extensions and then run them just like the built-in
Cargo tools is a super convenient benefit of Cargo’s design!</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#smart-pointers" id="smart-pointers"><h1>Smart Pointers</h1></a>
<p>A <em>pointer</em> is a general concept for a variable that contains an address in
memory. This address refers to, or “points at”, some other data. The most
common kind of pointer in Rust is a <em>reference</em>, which we learned about in
Chapter 4. References are indicated by the <code>&amp;</code> symbol and borrow the value that
they point to. They don’t have any special abilities other than referring to
data. They also don’t have any overhead, so they’re used the most often.</p>
<p><em>Smart pointers</em>, on the other hand, are data structures that act like a
pointer, but they also have additional metadata and capabilities. The concept
of smart pointers isn’t unique to Rust; it originated in C++ and exists in
other languages as well. The different smart pointers defined in Rust’s
standard library provide extra functionality beyond what references provide.
One example that we’ll explore in this chapter is the <em>reference counting</em>
smart pointer type, which enables you to have multiple owners of data. The
reference counting smart pointer keeps track of how many owners there are, and
when there aren’t any remaining, the smart pointer takes care of cleaning up
the data.</p>
<!-- maybe a brief explanation what deref and drop? I'm not really sure what
reference counting is here too, can you outline that in brief?-->
<!-- We've added a quick explanation of reference counting here and a brief
explanation of deref and drop below. /Carol -->
<!--(regarding C++) if this is relevant here, can you expand? Are we saying
they will be familiar to C++ people? -->
<!-- We were trying to say that "smart pointer" isn't something particular to
Rust; we've tried to clarify. /Carol -->
<p>In Rust, where we have the concept of ownership and borrowing, an additional
difference between references and smart pointers is that references are a kind
of pointer that only borrow data; by contrast, in many cases, smart pointers
<em>own</em> the data that they point to.</p>
<p>We’ve actually already encountered a few smart pointers in this book, such as
<code>String</code> and <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> from Chapter 8, though we didn’t call them smart pointers
at the time. Both these types count as smart pointers because they own some
memory and allow you to manipulate it. They also have metadata (such as their
capacity) and extra capabilities or guarantees (such as <code>String</code> ensuring its
data will always be valid UTF-8).</p>
<!-- Above: we said smart pointers don't own values earlier but in the
paragraph above we're saying String and Vec own memory, is that a
contradiction? -->
<!-- Our original text read: "In Rust, an additional difference between plain
references and smart pointers is that references are a kind of pointer that
only borrow data; by contrast, in many cases, smart pointers *own* the data
that they point to." You had edited this to say the opposite: "In Rust, smart
pointers can only borrow data, whereas in many other languages, smart pointers
*own* the data they point to." We had the "in rust" phrase not to distinguish
Rust's smart pointer implementation from other languages' smart pointer
implementations, but to acknowledge that the concept of borrowing and ownership
doesn't apply in many languages. The distinction between references borrowing
and smart pointers owning is important in the context of Rust. We've tried to
clarify the sentence talking about C++ and separate it from the discussion of
borrowing vs owning. So there shouldn't be a contradiction, and it should be
clearer that smart pointers usually own the data they point to. /Carol -->
<p>Smart pointers are usually implemented using structs. The characteristics that
distinguish a smart pointer from an ordinary struct are that smart pointers
implement the <code>Deref</code> and <code>Drop</code> traits. The <code>Deref</code> trait allows an instance
of the smart pointer struct to behave like a reference so that we can write
code that works with either references or smart pointers. The <code>Drop</code> trait
allows us to customize the code that gets run when an instance of the smart
pointer goes out of scope. In this chapter, we’ll be discussing both of those
traits and demonstrating why they’re important to smart pointers.</p>
<p>Given that the smart pointer pattern is a general design pattern used
frequently in Rust, this chapter won’t cover every smart pointer that exists.
Many libraries have their own smart pointers and you can even write some
yourself. We’ll just cover the most common smart pointers from the standard
library:</p>
<!-- Would it make sense to hyphenate reference-counted (and its derivations)
here? I think that would be more clear, but I don't want to do that if that's
not the Rust convention -->
<!-- The hyphenated version doesn't appear to be a general convention to me, it
looks like "reference counted" is most often not hyphenated. For example:

type exposes an API for mutating an interior value. We’ll also discuss

<a class="header" href="print.html#boxt-points-to-data-on-the-heap-and-has-a-known-size" id="boxt-points-to-data-on-the-heap-and-has-a-known-size"><h2><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> Points to Data on the Heap and Has a Known Size</h2></a>
<p>The most straightforward smart pointer is a <em>box</em>, whose type is written
<code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>. Boxes allow you to store data on the heap rather than the stack. What
remains on the stack is the pointer to the heap data. Refer back to Chapter 4
if you’d like to review the difference between the stack and the heap.</p>
<!-- do we mean, allows you to place a value on the heap rather than the
default behavior of placing it on the stack? Can you quickly recap on what the
advantage to this can be, help them know when they'd use this? -->
<!-- Correct! Recap below: /Carol -->
<p>Boxes don’t have performance overhead other than their data being on the heap
instead of on the stack, but they don’t have a lot of extra abilities either.
They’re most often used in these situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you have a type whose size can’t be known at compile time, and you want
to use a value of that type in a context that needs to know an exact size</li>
<li>When you have a large amount of data and you want to transfer ownership but
ensure the data won’t be copied when you do so</li>
<li>When you want to own a value and only care that it’s a type that implements a
particular trait rather than knowing the concrete type itself</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re going to demonstrate the first case in the rest of this section. To
elaborate on the other two situations a bit more: in the second case,
transferring ownership of a large amount of data can take a long time because
the data gets copied around on the stack. To improve performance in this
situation, we can store the large amount of data on the heap in a box. Then,
only the small amount of pointer data is copied around on the stack, and the
data stays in one place on the heap. The third case is known as a <em>trait
object</em>, and Chapter 17 has an entire section devoted just to that topic. So
know that what you learn here will be applied again in Chapter 17!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-a-boxt-to-store-data-on-the-heap" id="using-a-boxt-to-store-data-on-the-heap"><h3>Using a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> to Store Data on the Heap</h3></a>
<p>Before we get into a use case for <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, let’s get familiar with the syntax
and how to interact with values stored within a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Listing 15-1 shows how to use a box to store an <code>i32</code> on the heap:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let b = Box::new(5);
    println!(&quot;b = {}&quot;, b);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-1: Storing an <code>i32</code> value on the heap using a
box</span></p>
<p>We define the variable <code>b</code> to have the value of a <code>Box</code> that points to the
value <code>5</code>, which is allocated on the heap. This program will print <code>b = 5</code>; in
this case, we can access the data in the box in a similar way as we would if
this data was on the stack. Just like any value that has ownership of data,
when a box goes out of scope like <code>b</code> does at the end of <code>main</code>, it will be
deallocated. The deallocation happens for both the box (stored on the stack)
and the data it points to (stored on the heap).</p>
<p>Putting a single value on the heap isn’t very useful, so you won’t use boxes by
themselves in the way that Listing 15-1 does very often. Having values like a
single <code>i32</code> on the stack, where they’re stored by default is more appropriate
in the majority of cases. Let’s get into a case where boxes allow us to define
types that we wouldn’t be allowed to if we didn’t have boxes.</p>
<!-- is this what we mean, we wouldn't bother with a box for something that can
be done more simply with a variable? -->
<!-- No, this doesn't really have anything to do with variables; this example
is using both a variable and a box. I've tried to clarify. /Carol -->
<a class="header" href="print.html#boxes-enable-recursive-types" id="boxes-enable-recursive-types"><h3>Boxes Enable Recursive Types</h3></a>
<!-- (or something that encompasses everything we do with this example) -->
<!-- below: I'm unfamiliar with the cons concept, are we saying each value
except the first is repeated? does an item contain both its own value and the
next **item**, or the next **value**? Is it a continually nesting list? I'm
finding it hard to visualize -->
<!-- Did Figure 15-4 (trpl15-01.svg that I sent) help at all? /Carol-->
<p>Rust needs to know at compile time how much space a type takes up. One kind of
type whose size can’t be known at compile time is a <em>recursive type</em> where a
value can have as part of itself another value of the same type. This nesting
of values could theoretically continue infinitely, so Rust doesn’t know how
much space a value of a recursive type needs. Boxes have a known size, however,
so by inserting a box in a recursive type definition, we are allowed to have
recursive types.</p>
<p>Let’s explore the <em>cons list</em>, a data type common in functional programming
languages, to illustrate this concept. The cons list type we’re going to define
is straightforward except for the recursion, so the concepts in this example
will be useful any time you get into more complex situations involving
recursive types.</p>
<!-- can you also say why we're discussing cons lists in such depth? It seems
like a detour from the smart pointers conversation, is it just another concept
we're covering or is it imperative for learning about smart pointers? Either
way, can you lay that out up front, I think this could throw readers -->
<!-- A cons list is an example that's fairly simple but illustrates the use
case for Box. Readers may find themselves wanting to define a variety of
recursive types more complicated than cons lists in the future, and this
chapter demonstrates why box is the solution they should reach for in those
situations. We've tried to make that clearer in the above two paragraphs.
/Carol -->
<p>A cons list is a list where each item in the list contains two things: the
value of the current item and the next item. The last item in the list contains
only a value called <code>Nil</code> without a next item.</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#more-information-about-the-cons-list" id="more-information-about-the-cons-list"><h4>More Information About the Cons List</h4></a>
<p>A <em>cons list</em> is a data structure that comes from the Lisp programming
language and its dialects. In Lisp, the <code>cons</code> function (short for “construct
function”) constructs a new list from its two arguments, which usually are a
single value and another list.</p>
<p>The cons function concept has made its way into more general functional
programming jargon; “to cons x onto y” informally means to construct a new
container instance by putting the element x at the start of this new
container, followed by the container y.</p>
<p>A cons list is produced by recursively calling the <code>cons</code> function.
The canonical name to denote the base case of the recursion is <code>Nil</code>, which
announces the end of the list. Note that this is not the same as the “null”
or “nil” concept from Chapter 6, which is an invalid or absent value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that while functional programming languages use cons lists frequently,
this isn’t a commonly used data structure in Rust. Most of the time when you
have a list of items in Rust, <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> is a better choice. Other, more complex
recursive data types <em>are</em> useful in various situations in Rust, but by
starting with the cons list, we can explore how boxes let us define a recursive
data type without much distraction.</p>
<!-- If there isn't a better example for introducing box, I think we need more
justification for using cons lists here. This is supposed to be showing why box
is useful, but we're saying the thing we use box for isn't useful either. What
is it useful for, then? -->
<!-- We've tried to clarify. This is just a simple example to introduce box so
that the reader can use these concepts in more complicated situations. A more
realistic example would be quite a bit more complicated and obscure why a box
is useful even more. /Carol -->
<p>Listing 15-2 contains an enum definition for a cons list. Note that this
won’t compile quite yet because this is type doesn’t have a known size, which
we’ll demonstrate:</p>
<!-- why won't it compile? Are we just defining it to use in the next example?
Can you make it clear to the reader why they are doing this?-->
<!-- done /Carol -->

value is another <code>Cons</code> value that holds <code>2</code> and another <code>List</code> value. This

<code>Nil</code>, the non-recursive variant that signals the end of the list.</p>

<!-- Yes, this type is the most literal translation of the concept of a concept
to a Rust type, but it's not allowed in Rust. We have to use box to make the

tried to clarify throughout this section. /Carol -->
<p>The error says this type ‘has infinite size’. The reason is the way we’ve
defined <code>List</code> is with a variant that is recursive: it holds another value of
itself directly. This means Rust can’t figure out how much space it needs in
order to store a <code>List</code> value. Let’s break this down a bit: first let’s look at
how Rust decides how much space it needs to store a value of a non-recursive
type.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#computing-the-size-of-a-non-recursive-type" id="computing-the-size-of-a-non-recursive-type"><h3>Computing the Size of a Non-Recursive Type</h3></a>
<p>Recall the <code>Message</code> enum we defined in Listing 6-2 when we discussed enum
definitions in Chapter 6:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>To determine how much space to allocate for a <code>Message</code> value, Rust goes
through each of the variants to see which variant needs the most space. Rust
sees that <code>Message::Quit</code> doesn’t need any space, <code>Message::Move</code> needs enough
space to store two <code>i32</code> values, and so forth. Since only one variant will end
up being used, the most space a <code>Message</code> value will need is the space it would
take to store the largest of its variants.</p>
<p>Contrast this to what happens when Rust tries to determine how much space a
recursive type like the <code>List</code> enum in Listing 15-2 needs. The compiler starts
by looking at the <code>Cons</code> variant, which holds a value of type <code>i32</code> and a value
of type <code>List</code>. Therefore, <code>Cons</code> needs an amount of space equal to the size of
an <code>i32</code> plus the size of a <code>List</code>. To figure out how much memory the <code>List</code>
type needs, the compiler looks at the variants, starting with the <code>Cons</code>
variant. The <code>Cons</code> variant holds a value of type <code>i32</code> and a value of type
<code>List</code>, and this continues infinitely, as shown in Figure 15-5.</p>
<p><img alt="An infinite Cons list" src="img/trpl15-01.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 15-5: An infinite <code>List</code> consisting of infinite

<p>Rust can’t figure out how much space to allocate for recursively defined types,
so the compiler gives the error in Listing 15-4. The error does include this
helpful suggestion:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">= help: insert indirection (e.g., a `Box`, `Rc`, or `&amp;`) at some point to
        make `List` representable
</code></pre>
<p>In this suggestion, “indirection” means that instead of storing a value
directly, we’re going to store the value indirectly by storing a pointer to
the value instead.</p>
<p>Because a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> is a pointer, Rust always knows how much space a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>
needs: a pointer’s size doesn’t change based on the amount of data it’s
pointing to.</p>
<p>So we can put a <code>Box</code> inside the <code>Cons</code> variant instead of another <code>List</code> value
directly. The <code>Box</code> will point to the next <code>List</code> value that will be on the
heap, rather than inside the <code>Cons</code> variant. Conceptually, we still have a list
created by lists “holding” other lists, but the way this concept is implemented
is now more like the items being next to one another rather than inside one
another.</p>
<p>We can change the definition of the <code>List</code> enum from Listing 15-2 and the usage
of the <code>List</code> from Listing 15-3 to the code in Listing 15-6, which will compile:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">enum List {
    Cons(i32, Box&lt;List&gt;),
    Nil,
}

use List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let list = Cons(1,
        Box::new(Cons(2,
            Box::new(Cons(3,
                Box::new(Nil))))));
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-6: Definition of <code>List</code> that uses <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> in
order to have a known size</span></p>
<p>The <code>Cons</code> variant will need the size of an <code>i32</code> plus the space to store the
box’s pointer data. The <code>Nil</code> variant stores no values, so it needs less space
than the <code>Cons</code> variant. We now know that any <code>List</code> value will take up the
size of an <code>i32</code> plus the size of a box’s pointer data. By using a box, we’ve
broken the infinite, recursive chain so the compiler is able to figure out the
size it needs to store a <code>List</code> value. Figure 15-7 shows what the <code>Cons</code>
variant looks like now:</p>

<!-- Below: why use boxes for this example, then, and not a more common smart
pointer? -->
<!-- We're trying to introduce the reader to smart pointers by introducing the
simplest one first. We've reworded to hopefully address this. /Carol -->
<p>Boxes only provide the indirection and heap allocation; they don’t have any
other special abilities like those we’ll see with the other smart pointer
types. They also don’t have any performance overhead that these special
abilities incur, so they can be useful in cases like the cons list where the
indirection is the only feature we need. We’ll look at more use cases for boxes
in Chapter 17, too.</p>
<p>The <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> type is a smart pointer because it implements the <code>Deref</code> trait,
which allows <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> values to be treated like references. When a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>
value goes out of scope, the heap data that the box is pointing to is cleaned
up as well because of the <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> type’s <code>Drop</code> trait implementation. Let’s
explore these two traits in more detail; these traits are going to be even more
important to the functionality provided by the other smart pointer types we’ll
be discussing in the rest of this chapter.</p>
<!-- so deref and drop are features of Box and not of smart pointers? Or of
both? I'm not sure it's clear -->
<!-- We've tried to clarify. We wanted to demonstrate one smart pointer before
getting into these traits since they don't make much sense out of context, but
they're more important to understand before explaining the more complicated
smart pointers /Carol -->

a regular reference, we can write code that operates on references and use that

<p>Our <code>MyBox&lt;T&gt;</code> type can’t be dereferenced because we haven’t implemented that
ability on our type. To enable dereferencing with the <code>*</code> operator, we can
implement the <code>Deref</code> trait.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#implementing-the-deref-trait-defines-how-to-treat-a-type-like-a-reference" id="implementing-the-deref-trait-defines-how-to-treat-a-type-like-a-reference"><h3>Implementing the <code>Deref</code> Trait Defines How To Treat a Type Like a Reference</h3></a>
<p>As we discussed in Chapter 10, in order to implement a trait, we need to
provide implementations for the trait’s required methods. The <code>Deref</code> trait,
provided by the standard library, requires implementing one method named
<code>deref</code> that borrows <code>self</code> and returns a reference to the inner data. Listing
15-12 contains an implementation of <code>Deref</code> to add to the definition of <code>MyBox</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::ops::Deref;

# struct MyBox&lt;T&gt;(T);
impl&lt;T&gt; Deref for MyBox&lt;T&gt; {
    type Target = T;

    fn deref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;T {
        &amp;self.0
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-12: Implementing <code>Deref</code> on <code>MyBox&lt;T&gt;</code></span></p>
<p>The <code>type Target = T;</code> syntax defines an associated type for this trait to use.
Associated types are a slightly different way of declaring a generic parameter
that you don’t need to worry about too much for now; we’ll cover it in more
detail in Chapter 19.</p>
<!-- Is it possible to just use a method for declaring a generic parameter we
have seen before, so we can focus on the deref trait here? -->
<!-- No, this is how the `Deref` trait is defined in the standard library, so
this is what you have to specify in order to implement it. /Carol -->
<p>We filled in the body of the <code>deref</code> method with <code>&amp;self.0</code> so that <code>deref</code>
returns a reference to the value we want to access with the <code>*</code> operator. The
<code>main</code> function from Listing 15-11 that calls <code>*</code> on the <code>MyBox&lt;T&gt;</code> value now
compiles and the assertions pass!</p>
<p>Without the <code>Deref</code> trait, the compiler can only dereference <code>&amp;</code> references.
The <code>Deref</code> trait’s <code>deref</code> method gives the compiler the ability to take a
value of any type that implements <code>Deref</code> and call the <code>deref</code> method in order
to get a <code>&amp;</code> reference that it knows how to dereference.</p>
<p>When we typed <code>*y</code> in Listing 15-11, what Rust actually ran behind the scenes
was this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">*(y.deref())
</code></pre>
<!-- why is that happening behind the scenes, rather than us just calling this
up front? -->
<!-- we've tried to clarify below /Carol -->
<p>Rust substitutes the <code>*</code> operator with a call to the <code>deref</code> method and then a
plain dereference so that we don’t have to think about when we have to call the
<code>deref</code> method or not. This feature of Rust lets us write code that functions
identically whether we have a regular reference or a type that implements
<code>Deref</code>.</p>
<p>The reason the <code>deref</code> method returns a reference to a value, and why the plain
dereference outside the parentheses in <code>*(y.deref())</code> is still necessary, is
because of ownership. If the <code>deref</code> method returned the value directly instead
of a reference to the value, the value would be moved out of <code>self</code>. We don’t
want to take ownership of the inner value inside <code>MyBox&lt;T&gt;</code> in this case and in
most cases where we use the dereference operator.</p>
<p>Note that replacing <code>*</code> with a call to the <code>deref</code> method and then a call to
<code>*</code> happens once, each time we type a <code>*</code> in our code. The substitution of <code>*</code>
does not recurse infinitely. That’s how we end up with data of type <code>i32</code>,
which matches the <code>5</code> in the <code>assert_eq!</code> in Listing 15-11.</p>

<!--Below -- "A deref coercion happens when..." So this isn't something the
reader is making happen, but something that just happens behind the scene? If
not, can you change this to an active tone? -->
<!-- Yes, it is something that happens behind the scenes, which is why we
describe it as implicit. /Carol -->
<p><em>Deref coercion</em> is a convenience that Rust performs on arguments to functions
and methods. Deref coercion converts a reference to a type that implements
<code>Deref</code> into a reference to a type that <code>Deref</code> can convert the original type
into. Deref coercion happens automatically when we pass a reference to a value
of a particular type as an argument to a function or method that doesn’t match
the type of the parameter in the function or method definition, and there’s a
sequence of calls to the <code>deref</code> method that will convert the type we provided
into the type that the parameter needs.</p>
<p>Deref coercion was added to Rust so that programmers writing function and
method calls don’t need to add as many explicit references and dereferences
with <code>&amp;</code> and <code>*</code>. This feature also lets us write more code that can work for
either references or smart pointers.</p>
<p>To illustrate deref coercion in action, let’s use the <code>MyBox&lt;T&gt;</code> type we
defined in Listing 15-10 as well as the implementation of <code>Deref</code> that we added
in Listing 15-12. Listing 15-13 shows the definition of a function that has a
string slice parameter:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn hello(name: &amp;str) {
    println!(&quot;Hello, {}!&quot;, name);
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-13: A <code>hello</code> function that has the parameter
<code>name</code> of type <code>&amp;str</code></span></p>
<p>We can call the <code>hello</code> function with a string slice as an argument, like
<code>hello(&quot;Rust&quot;);</code> for example. Deref coercion makes it possible for us to call
<code>hello</code> with a reference to a value of type <code>MyBox&lt;String&gt;</code>, as shown in
Listing 15-14:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># use std::ops::Deref;
#
# struct MyBox&lt;T&gt;(T);

#     fn new(x: T) -&gt; MyBox&lt;T&gt; {
#         MyBox(x)
#     }
# }
#
# impl&lt;T&gt; Deref for MyBox&lt;T&gt; {
#     type Target = T;
#
#     fn deref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;T {
#         &amp;self.0
#     }
# }
#
# fn hello(name: &amp;str) {
#     println!(&quot;Hello, {}!&quot;, name);
# }
#
fn main() {
    let m = MyBox::new(String::from(&quot;Rust&quot;));
    hello(&amp;m);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-14: Calling <code>hello</code> with a reference to a
<code>MyBox&lt;String&gt;</code>, which works because of deref coercion</span></p>
<p>Here we’re calling the <code>hello</code> function with the argument <code>&amp;m</code>, which is a
reference to a <code>MyBox&lt;String&gt;</code> value. Because we implemented the <code>Deref</code> trait
on <code>MyBox&lt;T&gt;</code> in Listing 15-12, Rust can turn <code>&amp;MyBox&lt;String&gt;</code> into <code>&amp;String</code>
by calling <code>deref</code>. The standard library provides an implementation of <code>Deref</code>
on <code>String</code> that returns a string slice, which we can see in the API
documentation for <code>Deref</code>. Rust calls <code>deref</code> again to turn the <code>&amp;String</code> into
<code>&amp;str</code>, which matches the <code>hello</code> function’s definition.</p>
<p>If Rust didn’t implement deref coercion, in order to call <code>hello</code> with a value
of type <code>&amp;MyBox&lt;String&gt;</code>, we’d have to write the code in Listing 15-15 instead
of the code in Listing 15-14:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># use std::ops::Deref;

#
#     fn deref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;T {
#         &amp;self.0
#     }

    let m = MyBox::new(String::from(&quot;Rust&quot;));
    hello(&amp;(*m)[..]);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-15: The code we’d have to write if Rust didn’t
have deref coercion</span></p>
<p>The <code>(*m)</code> is dereferencing the <code>MyBox&lt;String&gt;</code> into a <code>String</code>. Then the <code>&amp;</code>
and <code>[..]</code> are taking a string slice of the <code>String</code> that is equal to the whole
string to match the signature of <code>hello</code>. The code without deref coercions is
harder to read, write, and understand with all of these symbols involved. Deref
coercion makes it so that Rust takes care of these conversions for us
automatically.</p>
<p>When the <code>Deref</code> trait is defined for the types involved, Rust will analyze the
types and use <code>Deref::deref</code> as many times as it needs in order to get a
reference to match the parameter’s type. This is resolved at compile time, so
there is no run-time penalty for taking advantage of deref coercion!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#how-deref-coercion-interacts-with-mutability" id="how-deref-coercion-interacts-with-mutability"><h3>How Deref Coercion Interacts with Mutability</h3></a>
<!-- below: are we talking about any mutable references, or are we talking
about mutable generic types, below? Can you make sure it's clear throughout, I
wasn't 100% -->
<!-- I'm not sure what you're asking, *types* don't have the property of
mutability or immutability, it's the variables or references to *instances* of
those types that are mutable or immutable. Also the way to say "any mutable
reference" is with `&mut` and a generic type parameter. Is that what's
confusing? /Carol -->
<p>Similar to how we use the <code>Deref</code> trait to override <code>*</code> on immutable
references, Rust provides a <code>DerefMut</code> trait for overriding <code>*</code> on mutable
references.</p>
<p>Rust does deref coercion when it finds types and trait implementations in three
cases:</p>
<!-- Would it make sense to move this list to the start of the deref section?
-->
<!-- I don't think this list makes very much sense until you understand what
deref coercion *is*. Can you elaborate on why you think it should be moved to
the beginning? /Carol -->
<ul>
<li>From <code>&amp;T</code> to <code>&amp;U</code> when <code>T: Deref&lt;Target=U&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>From <code>&amp;mut T</code> to <code>&amp;mut U</code> when <code>T: DerefMut&lt;Target=U&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>From <code>&amp;mut T</code> to <code>&amp;U</code> when <code>T: Deref&lt;Target=U&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two cases are the same except for mutability. The first case says
that if you have a <code>&amp;T</code>, and <code>T</code> implements <code>Deref</code> to some type <code>U</code>, you can
get a <code>&amp;U</code> transparently. The second case states that the same deref coercion
happens for mutable references.</p>
<p>The last case is trickier: Rust will also coerce a mutable reference to an
immutable one. The reverse is <em>not</em> possible though: immutable references will
never coerce to mutable ones. Because of the borrowing rules, if you have a
mutable reference, that mutable reference must be the only reference to that
data (otherwise, the program wouldn’t compile). Converting one mutable
reference to one immutable reference will never break the borrowing rules.
Converting an immutable reference to a mutable reference would require that
there was only one immutable reference to that data, and the borrowing rules
don’t guarantee that. Therefore, Rust can’t make the assumption that converting
an immutable reference to a mutable reference is possible.</p>
<!-- Why does it coerce to an immutable reference, and why cant it go the other
way?-->
<!-- Elaborated above /Carol-->
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-drop-trait-runs-code-on-cleanup" id="the-drop-trait-runs-code-on-cleanup"><h2>The <code>Drop</code> Trait Runs Code on Cleanup</h2></a>
<p>The second trait important to the smart pointer pattern is <code>Drop</code>, which lets
us customize what happens when a value is about to go out of scope. We can
provide an implementation for the <code>Drop</code> trait on any type, and the code we
specify can be used to release resources like files or network connections.
We’re introducing <code>Drop</code> in the context of smart pointers because the
functionality of the <code>Drop</code> trait is almost always used when implementing a
smart pointer. For example, <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> customizes <code>Drop</code> in order to deallocate
the space on the heap that the box points to.</p>
<p>In some languages, the programmer must call code to free memory or resources
every time they finish using an instance of a smart pointer. If they forget,
the system might become overloaded and crash. In Rust, we can specify that a
particular bit of code should be run whenever a value goes out of scope, and
the compiler will insert this code automatically.</p>
<!-- Are we saying that any code can be run, and that we can use that to clean
up, or that this code that can be run is specifically always for clean up? -->
<!-- I don't understand what the difference between those two choices are?
/Carol -->
<p>This means we don’t need to be careful about placing clean up code everywhere
in a program that an instance of a particular type is finished with, but we
still won’t leak resources!</p>
<p>We specify the code to run when a value goes out of scope by implementing the
<code>Drop</code> trait. The <code>Drop</code> trait requires us to implement one method named <code>drop</code>
that takes a mutable reference to <code>self</code>. In order to be able to see when Rust
calls <code>drop</code>, let’s implement <code>drop</code> with <code>println!</code> statements for now.</p>
<!-- Why are we showing this as an example and not an example of it being used
for clean up? -->
<!-- To demonstrate the mechanics of implementing the trait and showing when
this code gets run. It's hard to experience the cleaning up unless we print
something. /Carol -->
<p>Listing 15-16 shows a <code>CustomSmartPointer</code> struct whose only custom
functionality is that it will print out <code>Dropping CustomSmartPointer!</code> when the
instance goes out of scope. This will demonstrate when Rust runs the <code>drop</code>
function:</p>
<!-- Is this below just telling us how to adapt it for cleaning up instead?
Maybe save it for when we have context for it? Instead of a `println!`
statement, you'd fill in `drop` with whatever cleanup code your smart pointer
needs to run: -->
<!-- This is demonstrating what we need to do to use `Drop`, without getting
into the complexities of what "cleaning up" might mean yet, just to give the

the order in which they were created, so <code>d</code> was dropped before <code>c</code>. This is
just to give you a visual guide to how the drop method works, but usually you

other code in the same scope can acquire the lock. First, let’s see what

<!-- How does this show that the destructor code (is that drop?) is called? Is
this correct, above?-->
<!-- The order of what gets printed shows that the drop code is called.
/Carol-->
<p>Code specified in a <code>Drop</code> trait implementation can be used in many ways to
make cleanup convenient and safe: we could use it to create our own memory
allocator, for instance! With the <code>Drop</code> trait and Rust’s ownership system, you
don’t have to remember to clean up after yourself, Rust takes care of it
automatically.</p>
<p>We also don’t have to worry about accidentally cleaning up values still in use
because that would cause a compiler error: the ownership system that makes sure
references are always valid will also make sure that <code>drop</code> only gets called
once when the value is no longer being used.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve gone over <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> and some of the characteristics of smart
pointers, let’s talk about a few other smart pointers defined in the standard
library.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#rct-the-reference-counted-smart-pointer" id="rct-the-reference-counted-smart-pointer"><h2><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, the Reference Counted Smart Pointer</h2></a>
<p>In the majority of cases, ownership is clear: you know exactly which variable
owns a given value. However, there are cases when a single value may have
multiple owners. For example, in graph data structures, multiple edges may
point to the same node, and that node is conceptually owned by all of the edges
that point to it. A node shouldn’t be cleaned up unless it doesn’t have any
edges pointing to it.</p>
<!-- Can you give an example or two for when a variable needs multiple owners?
-->
<!-- Done /Carol -->
<p>In order to enable multiple ownership, Rust has a type called <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>. Its name
is an abbreviation for reference counting. <em>Reference counting</em> means keeping
track of the number of references to a value in order to know if a value is
still in use or not. If there are zero references to a value, the value can be
cleaned up without any references becoming invalid.</p>
<p>Imagine it like a TV in a family room. When one person enters to watch TV, they
turn it on. Others can come into the room and watch the TV. When the last
person leaves the room, they turn the TV off because it’s no longer being used.
If someone turns the TV off while others are still watching it, there’d be
uproar from the remaining TV watchers!</p>
<p><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is used when we want to allocate some data on the heap for multiple
parts of our program to read, and we can’t determine at compile time which part
will finish using the data last. If we did know which part would finish last,
we could just make that the owner of the data and the normal ownership rules
enforced at compile time would kick in.</p>
<p>Note that <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is only for use in single-threaded scenarios; Chapter 16 on
concurrency will cover how to do reference counting in multithreaded programs.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-rct-to-share-data" id="using-rct-to-share-data"><h3>Using <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> to Share Data</h3></a>
<p>Let’s return to our cons list example from Listing 15-6, as we defined it using
<code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>. This time, we want to create two lists that both share ownership of a
third list, which conceptually will look something like Figure 15-19:</p>
<p><img alt="Two lists that share ownership of a third list" src="img/trpl15-03.svg" class="center" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 15-19: Two lists, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>, sharing ownership
of a third list, <code>a</code></span></p>
<p>We’ll create list <code>a</code> that contains 5 and then 10, then make two more lists:
<code>b</code> that starts with 3 and <code>c</code> that starts with 4. Both <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> lists will
then continue on to the first <code>a</code> list containing 5 and 10. In other words,
both lists will try to share the first list containing 5 and 10.</p>
<p>Trying to implement this using our definition of <code>List</code> with <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> won’t
work, as shown in Listing 15-20:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

            Box::new(Nil))));

    let c = Cons(4, Box::new(a));
}

   = note: move occurs because `a` has type `List`, which does not
   implement the `Copy` trait
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Cons</code> variants own the data they hold, so when we create the <code>b</code> list, <code>a</code>
is moved into <code>b</code> and <code>b</code> owns <code>a</code>. Then, when we try to use <code>a</code> again when
creating <code>c</code>, we’re not allowed to because <code>a</code> has been moved.</p>
<p>We could change the definition of <code>Cons</code> to hold references instead, but then
we’d have to specify lifetime parameters. By specifying lifetime parameters,
we’d be specifying that every element in the list will live at least as long as
the list itself. The borrow checker wouldn’t let us compile <code>let a = Cons(10, &amp;Nil);</code> for example, since the temporary <code>Nil</code> value would be dropped before
<code>a</code> could take a reference to it.</p>
<p>Instead, we’ll change our definition of <code>List</code> to use <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> in place of
<code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> as shown here in Listing 15-21. Each <code>Cons</code> variant now holds a value
and an <code>Rc</code> pointing to a <code>List</code>. When we create <code>b</code>, instead of taking
ownership of <code>a</code>, we clone the <code>Rc</code> that <code>a</code> is holding, which increases the
number of references from 1 to 2 and lets <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> share ownership of the
data in that <code>Rc</code>. We also clone <code>a</code> when creating <code>c</code>, which increases the
number of references from 2 to 3. Every time we call <code>Rc::clone</code>, the reference
count to the data within the <code>Rc</code> is increased, and the data won’t be cleaned
up unless there are zero references to it:</p>
<!-- And what will Rc do that's different here, how will the ownership of a b
c change? Could you write a paragraph equivalent to the one describing the cons
variants above? That was really useful -->

function and pass a reference to the <code>Rc</code> in <code>a</code> as an argument.</p>
<p>We could have called <code>a.clone()</code> rather than <code>Rc::clone(&amp;a)</code>, but Rust
convention is to use <code>Rc::clone</code> in this case. The implementation of <code>Rc::clone</code>
doesn’t make a deep copy of all the data like most types’ implementations of
<code>clone</code> do. <code>Rc::clone</code> only increments the reference count, which doesn’t take
very much time. Deep copies of data can take a lot of time, so by using
<code>Rc::clone</code> for reference counting, we can visually distinguish between the
deep copy kinds of clones that might have a large impact on runtime performance
and memory usage and the types of clones that increase the reference count that
have a comparatively small impact on runtime performance and don’t allocate new
memory.</p>

<p>We’re able to see that the <code>Rc</code> in <code>a</code> has an initial reference count of one,
then each time we call <code>clone</code>, the count goes up by one. When <code>c</code> goes out of
scope, the count goes down by one. We don’t have to call a function to decrease
the reference count like we have to call <code>Rc::clone</code> to increase the reference
count; the implementation of the <code>Drop</code> trait decreases the reference count
automatically when an <code>Rc</code> value goes out of scope.</p>
<p>What we can’t see from this example is that when <code>b</code> and then <code>a</code> go out of
scope at the end of <code>main</code>, the count is then 0, and the <code>Rc</code> is cleaned up
completely at that point. Using <code>Rc</code> allows a single value to have multiple
owners, and the count will ensure that the value remains valid as long as any
of the owners still exist.</p>
<p><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> allows us to share data between multiple parts of our program for
reading only, via immutable references. If <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> allowed us to have multiple
mutable references too, we’d be able to violate one of the borrowing rules
that we discussed in Chapter 4: multiple mutable borrows to the same place can
cause data races and inconsistencies. But being able to mutate data is very
useful! In the next section, we’ll discuss the interior mutability pattern and
the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type that we can use in conjunction with an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> to work
with this restriction on immutability.</p>

<!-- When we choose to use types implemented using the interior mutability

pattern. /Carol -->
<p><em>Interior mutability</em> is a design pattern in Rust for allowing you to mutate
data even when there are immutable references to that data, normally disallowed
by the borrowing rules. To do so, the pattern uses <code>unsafe</code> code inside a data
structure to bend Rust’s usual rules around mutation and borrowing. We haven’t
yet covered unsafe code; we will in Chapter 19. We can choose to use types that
make use of the interior mutability pattern when we can ensure that the
borrowing rules will be followed at runtime, even though the compiler can’t
ensure that. The <code>unsafe</code> code involved is then wrapped in a safe API, and the
outer type is still immutable.</p>
<p>Let’s explore this by looking at the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type that follows the
interior mutability pattern.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#enforcing-borrowing-rules-at-runtime-with-refcellt" id="enforcing-borrowing-rules-at-runtime-with-refcellt"><h3>Enforcing Borrowing Rules at Runtime with <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></h3></a>
<p>Unlike <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type represents single ownership over the data
it holds. So, what makes <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> different than a type like <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>?
Let’s recall the borrowing rules we learned in Chapter 4:</p>
<ol>
<li>At any given time, you can have <em>either</em> but not both of:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>One mutable reference.</li>
<li>Any number of immutable references.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>References must always be valid.</li>
</ol>
<p>With references and <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, the borrowing rules’ invariants are enforced at
compile time. With <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, these invariants are enforced <em>at runtime</em>.
With references, if you break these rules, you’ll get a compiler error. With
<code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, if you break these rules, you’ll get a <code>panic!</code>.</p>
<!-- Is there an advantage to having these rules enforced at different times?
-->
<!-- Yes, that's what we were trying to say below, we've tried to make this more explicit /Carol -->
<p>The advantages to checking the borrowing rules at compile time are that errors
will be caught sooner in the development process and there is no impact on
runtime performance since all the analysis is completed beforehand. For those
reasons, checking the borrowing rules at compile time is the best choice for
the majority of cases, which is why this is Rust’s default.</p>
<p>The advantage to checking the borrowing rules at runtime instead is that
certain memory safe scenarios are then allowed, whereas they are disallowed by
the compile time checks. Static analysis, like the Rust compiler, is inherently
conservative. Some properties of code are impossible to detect by analyzing the
code: the most famous example is the Halting Problem, which is out of scope of
this book but an interesting topic to research if you’re interested.</p>
<!--below: can't be sure of what, exactly? Sure that the code complies with the
ownership rules? -->
<!-- Yes /Carol -->
<p>Because some analysis is impossible, if the Rust compiler can’t be sure the
code complies with the ownership rules, it may reject a correct program; in
this way, it is conservative. If Rust were to accept an incorrect program,
users would not be able to trust in the guarantees Rust makes. However, if Rust
rejects a correct program, the programmer will be inconvenienced, but nothing
catastrophic can occur. <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> is useful when you yourself are sure that
your code follows the borrowing rules, but the compiler is not able to
understand and guarantee that.</p>
<p>Similarly to <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> is only for use in single-threaded scenarios
and will give you a compile time error if you try in a multithreaded context.
We’ll talk about how to get the functionality of <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> in a
multithreaded program in Chapter 16.</p>
<!-- I'm not really clear at this point what the difference between Rc<T> and
RefCell<T> is, perhaps a succinct round up would help? -->
<!-- Done /Carol -->
<p>To recap the reasons to choose <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, or <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> enables multiple owners of the same data; <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>
have single owners.</li>
<li><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time; <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>
only allows immutable borrows checked at compile time; <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> allows
immutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.</li>
<li>Because <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, we can mutate
the value inside the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> even when the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> is itself
immutable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last reason is the <em>interior mutability</em> pattern. Let’s look at a case when
interior mutability is useful and discuss how this is possible.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#interior-mutability-a-mutable-borrow-to-an-immutable-value" id="interior-mutability-a-mutable-borrow-to-an-immutable-value"><h3>Interior Mutability: A Mutable Borrow to an Immutable Value</h3></a>
<p>A consequence of the borrowing rules is that when we have an immutable value,
we can’t borrow it mutably. For example, this code won’t compile:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = &amp;mut x;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If we try to compile this, we’ll get this error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0596]: cannot borrow immutable local variable `x` as mutable
 --&gt; src/main.rs:3:18
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         - consider changing this to `mut x`
3 |     let y = &amp;mut x;
  |                  ^ cannot borrow mutably
</code></pre>
<p>However, there are situations where it would be useful for a value to be able
to mutate itself in its methods, but to other code, the value would appear to
be immutable. Code outside the value’s methods would not be able to mutate the
value. <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> is one way to get the ability to have interior mutability.
<code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> isn’t getting around the borrowing rules completely, but the
borrow checker in the compiler allows this interior mutability and the
borrowing rules are checked at runtime instead. If we violate the rules, we’ll
get a <code>panic!</code> instead of a compiler error.</p>
<p>Let’s work through a practical example where we can use <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> to make it
possible to mutate an immutable value and see why that’s useful.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a-use-case-for-interior-mutability-mock-objects" id="a-use-case-for-interior-mutability-mock-objects"><h4>A Use Case for Interior Mutability: Mock Objects</h4></a>
<p>A <em>test double</em> is the general programming concept for a type that stands in
the place of another type during testing. <em>Mock objects</em> are specific types of
test doubles that record what happens during a test so that we can assert that
the correct actions took place.</p>
<p>While Rust doesn’t have objects in the exact same sense that other languages
have objects, and Rust doesn’t have mock object functionality built into the
standard library like some other languages do, we can definitely create a
struct that will serve the same purposes as a mock object.</p>
<p>Here’s the scenario we’d like to test: we’re creating a library that tracks a
value against a maximum value, and sends messages based on how close to the
maximum value the current value is. This could be used for keeping track of a
user’s quota for the number of API calls they’re allowed to make, for example.</p>
<p>Our library is only going to provide the functionality of tracking how close to
the maximum a value is, and what the messages should be at what times.
Applications that use our library will be expected to provide the actual
mechanism for sending the messages: the application could choose to put a
message in the application, send an email, send a text message, or something
else. Our library doesn’t need to know about that detail; all it needs is
something that implements a trait we’ll provide called <code>Messenger</code>. Listing
15-23 shows our library code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">

    value: usize,
    max: usize,
}

    where T: Messenger {
    pub fn new(messenger: &amp;T, max: usize) -&gt; LimitTracker&lt;T&gt; {
        LimitTracker {
            messenger,
            value: 0,
            max,
        }
    }

    pub fn set_value(&amp;mut self, value: usize) {
        self.value = value;

        let percentage_of_max = self.value as f64 / self.max as f64;

        if percentage_of_max &gt;= 0.75 &amp;&amp; percentage_of_max &lt; 0.9 {
            self.messenger.send(&quot;Warning: You've used up over 75% of your quota!&quot;);
        } else if percentage_of_max &gt;= 0.9 &amp;&amp; percentage_of_max &lt; 1.0 {
            self.messenger.send(&quot;Urgent warning: You've used up over 90% of your quota!&quot;);
        } else if percentage_of_max &gt;= 1.0 {

<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-23: A library to keep track of how close to a

<p>One important part of this code is that the <code>Messenger</code> trait has one method,
<code>send</code>, that takes an immutable reference to <code>self</code> and text of the message.
This is the interface our mock object will need to have. The other important
part is that we want to test the behavior of the <code>set_value</code> method on the
<code>LimitTracker</code>. We can change what we pass in for the <code>value</code> parameter, but
<code>set_value</code> doesn’t return anything for us to make assertions on. What we want
to be able to say is that if we create a <code>LimitTracker</code> with something that
implements the <code>Messenger</code> trait and a particular value for <code>max</code>, when we pass
different numbers for <code>value</code>, the messenger gets told to send the appropriate
messages.</p>
<p>What we need is a mock object that, instead of actually sending an email or
text message when we call <code>send</code>, will only keep track of the messages it’s
told to send. We can create a new instance of the mock object, create a
<code>LimitTracker</code> that uses the mock object, call the <code>set_value</code> method on
<code>LimitTracker</code>, then check that the mock object has the messages we expect.
Listing 15-24 shows an attempt of implementing a mock object to do just that,
but that the borrow checker won’t allow:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-24: An attempt to implement a <code>MockMessenger</code>
that isn’t allowed by the borrow checker</span></p>
<p>This test code defines a <code>MockMessenger</code> struct that has a <code>sent_messages</code>
field with a <code>Vec</code> of <code>String</code> values to keep track of the messages it’s told
to send. We also defined an associated function <code>new</code> to make it convenient to
create new <code>MockMessenger</code> values that start with an empty list of messages. We
then implement the <code>Messenger</code> trait for <code>MockMessenger</code> so that we can give a
<code>MockMessenger</code> to a <code>LimitTracker</code>. In the definition of the <code>send</code> method, we
take the message passed in as a parameter and store it in the <code>MockMessenger</code>
list of <code>sent_messages</code>.</p>
<p>In the test, we’re testing what happens when the <code>LimitTracker</code> is told to set
<code>value</code> to something that’s over 75% of the <code>max</code> value. First, we create a new
<code>MockMessenger</code>, which will start with an empty list of messages. Then we
create a new <code>LimitTracker</code> and give it a reference to the new <code>MockMessenger</code>
and a <code>max</code> value of 100. We call the <code>set_value</code> method on the <code>LimitTracker</code>
with a value of 80, which is more than 75% of 100. Then we assert that the list
of messages that the <code>MockMessenger</code> is keeping track of should now have one
message in it.</p>
<p>There’s one problem with this test, however:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0596]: cannot borrow immutable field `self.sent_messages` as mutable

<p>We can’t modify the <code>MockMessenger</code> to keep track of the messages because the

suggestion from the error text to use <code>&amp;mut self</code> instead because then the
signature of <code>send</code> wouldn’t match the signature in the <code>Messenger</code> trait
definition (feel free to try and see what error message you get).</p>
<p>This is where interior mutability can help! We’re going to store the
<code>sent_messages</code> within a <code>RefCell</code>, and then the <code>send</code> message will be able to
modify <code>sent_messages</code> to store the messages we’ve seen. Listing 15-25 shows
what that looks like:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-25: Using <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> to be able to mutate an
inner value while the outer value is considered immutable</span></p>
<p>The <code>sent_messages</code> field is now of type <code>RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code> instead of
<code>Vec&lt;String&gt;</code>. In the <code>new</code> function, we create a new <code>RefCell</code> instance around
the empty vector.</p>
<p>For the implementation of the <code>send</code> method, the first parameter is still an
immutable borrow of <code>self</code>, which matches the trait definition. We call
<code>borrow_mut</code> on the <code>RefCell</code> in <code>self.sent_messages</code> to get a mutable
reference to the value inside the <code>RefCell</code>, which is the vector. Then we can
call <code>push</code> on the mutable reference to the vector in order to keep track of
the messages seen during the test.</p>
<p>The last change we have to make is in the assertion: in order to see how many
items are in the inner vector, we call <code>borrow</code> on the <code>RefCell</code> to get an
immutable reference to the vector.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve seen how to use <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, let’s dig into how it works!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#refcellt-keeps-track-of-borrows-at-runtime" id="refcellt-keeps-track-of-borrows-at-runtime"><h4><code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> Keeps Track of Borrows at Runtime</h4></a>
<p>When creating immutable and mutable references we use the <code>&amp;</code> and <code>&amp;mut</code>
syntax, respectively. With <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, we use the <code>borrow</code> and <code>borrow_mut</code>
methods, which are part of the safe API that belongs to <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>. The
<code>borrow</code> method returns the smart pointer type <code>Ref</code>, and <code>borrow_mut</code> returns
the smart pointer type <code>RefMut</code>. Both types implement <code>Deref</code> so we can treat
them like regular references.</p>
<!-- can you clarify what you mean, practically, by "track borrows
dynamically"?-->
<!-- Yep, we've tried to clarify in the next paragraph. /Carol -->
<p>The <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> keeps track of how many <code>Ref</code> and <code>RefMut</code> smart pointers are
currently active. Every time we call <code>borrow</code>, the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> increases its
count of how many immutable borrows are active. When a <code>Ref</code> value goes out of
scope, the count of immutable borrows goes down by one. Just like the compile
time borrowing rules, <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> lets us have many immutable borrows or one
mutable borrow at any point in time.</p>
<p>If we try to violate these rules, rather than getting a compiler error like we
would with references, the implementation of <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> will <code>panic!</code> at
runtime. Listing 15-26 shows a modification to the implementation of <code>send</code>
from Listing 15-25 where we’re deliberately trying to create two mutable
borrows active for the same scope in order to illustrate that <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>
prevents us from doing this at runtime:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
    fn send(&amp;self, message: &amp;str) {
        let mut one_borrow = self.sent_messages.borrow_mut();
        let mut two_borrow = self.sent_messages.borrow_mut();

        one_borrow.push(String::from(message));
        two_borrow.push(String::from(message));
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-26: Creating two mutable references in the
same scope to see that <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> will panic</span></p>
<p>We create a variable <code>one_borrow</code> for the <code>RefMut</code> smart pointer returned from
<code>borrow_mut</code>. Then we create another mutable borrow in the same way in the
variable <code>two_borrow</code>. This makes two mutable references in the same scope,
which isn’t allowed. If we run the tests for our library, this code will
compile without any errors, but the test will fail:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">---- tests::it_sends_an_over_75_percent_warning_message stdout ----

    'already borrowed: BorrowMutError', src/libcore/result.rs:906:4
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that the code panicked with the message <code>already borrowed: BorrowMutError</code>. This is how <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> handles violations of the borrowing
rules at runtime.</p>
<p>Catching borrowing errors at runtime rather than compile time means that we’d
find out that we made a mistake in our code later in the development process--
and possibly not even until our code was deployed to production. There’s also a
small runtime performance penalty our code will incur as a result of keeping
track of the borrows at runtime rather than compile time. However, using
<code>RefCell</code> made it possible for us to write a mock object that can modify itself
to keep track of the messages it has seen while we’re using it in a context
where only immutable values are allowed. We can choose to use <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>
despite its tradeoffs to get more abilities than regular references give us.</p>

<p>A common way to use <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> is in combination with <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>. Recall that
<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> lets us have multiple owners of some data, but it only gives us
immutable access to that data. If we have an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> that holds a <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>,
then we can get a value that can have multiple owners <em>and</em> that we can mutate!</p>
<!-- maybe just recap on why we'd want that? -->
<!-- done, below /Carol -->
<p>For example, recall the cons list example from Listing 15-13 where we used
<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> to let us have multiple lists share ownership of another list. Because
<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> only holds immutable values, we aren’t able to change any of the values
in the list once we’ve created them. Let’s add in <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> to get the
ability to change the values in the lists. Listing 15-27 shows that by using a
<code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> in the <code>Cons</code> definition, we’re allowed to modify the value stored
in all the lists:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Debug)]
enum List {
    Cons(Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;i32&gt;&gt;, Rc&lt;List&gt;),
    Nil,
}

use List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

fn main() {
    let value = Rc::new(RefCell::new(5));

    let a = Rc::new(Cons(Rc::clone(&amp;value), Rc::new(Nil)));

    let b = Cons(Rc::new(RefCell::new(6)), Rc::clone(&amp;a));
    let c = Cons(Rc::new(RefCell::new(10)), Rc::clone(&amp;a));

    *value.borrow_mut() += 10;

    println!(&quot;a after = {:?}&quot;, a);
    println!(&quot;b after = {:?}&quot;, b);
    println!(&quot;c after = {:?}&quot;, c);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-27: Using <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;i32&gt;&gt;</code> to create a
<code>List</code> that we can mutate</span></p>
<p>We create a value that’s an instance of <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;i32&gt;</code> and store it in a
variable named <code>value</code> so we can access it directly later. Then we create a
<code>List</code> in <code>a</code> with a <code>Cons</code> variant that holds <code>value</code>. We need to clone
<code>value</code> so that both <code>a</code> and <code>value</code> have ownership of the inner <code>5</code> value,
rather than transferring ownership from <code>value</code> to <code>a</code> or having <code>a</code> borrow
from <code>value</code>.</p>
<!-- above: so that `value` has ownership of what, in addition to a? I didn't
follow the final sentence above -->
<!-- Of the inner value, I've tried to clarify /Carol -->
<p>We wrap the list <code>a</code> in an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> so that when we create lists <code>b</code> and
<code>c</code>, they can both refer to <code>a</code>, the same as we did in Listing 15-13.</p>
<p>Once we have the lists in <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> created, we add 10 to the value in
<code>value</code>. We do this by calling <code>borrow_mut</code> on <code>value</code>, which uses the
automatic dereferencing feature we discussed in Chapter 5 (“Where’s the <code>-&gt;</code>
Operator?”) to dereference the <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> to the inner <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> value. The
<code>borrow_mut</code> method returns a <code>RefMut&lt;T&gt;</code> smart pointer, and we use the
dereference operator on it and change the inner value.</p>
<p>When we print out <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, we can see that they all have the modified
value of 15 rather than 5:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">a after = Cons(RefCell { value: 15 }, Nil)
b after = Cons(RefCell { value: 6 }, Cons(RefCell { value: 15 }, Nil))
c after = Cons(RefCell { value: 10 }, Cons(RefCell { value: 15 }, Nil))
</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty neat! By using <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, we have an outwardly immutable
<code>List</code>, but we can use the methods on <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> that provide access to its
interior mutability so we can modify our data when we need to. The runtime
checks of the borrowing rules protect us from data races, and it’s sometimes
worth trading a bit of speed for this flexibility in our data structures.</p>
<p>The standard library has other types that provide interior mutability, too,
like <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>, which is similar except that instead of giving references to
the inner value, the value is copied in and out of the <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>. There’s also
<code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>, which offers interior mutability that’s safe to use across threads,
and we’ll be discussing its use in the next chapter on concurrency. Check out
the standard library docs for more details on the differences between these
types.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#reference-cycles-can-leak-memory" id="reference-cycles-can-leak-memory"><h2>Reference Cycles Can Leak Memory</h2></a>
<p>Rust’s memory safety guarantees make it <em>difficult</em> to accidentally create
memory that’s never cleaned up, known as a <em>memory leak</em>, but not impossible.
Entirely preventing memory leaks is not one of Rust’s guarantees in the same
way that disallowing data races at compile time is, meaning memory leaks are
memory safe in Rust. We can see this with <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>: it’s
possible to create references where items refer to each other in a cycle. This
creates memory leaks because the reference count of each item in the cycle will
never reach 0, and the values will never be dropped.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-a-reference-cycle" id="creating-a-reference-cycle"><h3>Creating a Reference Cycle</h3></a>
<p>Let’s take a look at how a reference cycle might happen and how to prevent it,
starting with the definition of the <code>List</code> enum and a <code>tail</code> method in Listing
15-28:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::rc::Rc;

        match *self {
            Cons(_, ref item) =&gt; Some(item),
            Nil =&gt; None,
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-28: A cons list definition that holds a
<code>RefCell</code> so that we can modify what a <code>Cons</code> variant is referring to</span></p>
<p>We’re using another variation of the <code>List</code> definition from Listing 15-6. The
second element in the <code>Cons</code> variant is now <code>RefCell&lt;Rc&lt;List&gt;&gt;</code>, meaning that
instead of having the ability to modify the <code>i32</code> value like we did in Listing
15-19, we want to be able to modify which <code>List</code> a <code>Cons</code> variant is pointing
to. We’ve also added a <code>tail</code> method to make it convenient for us to access the
second item, if we have a <code>Cons</code> variant.</p>
<!-- Can you link this more clearly, what do we have at this point? This change

referring to the listing above or the listing below? The listing above is just
definitions we're going to use, the listing below is the `main` function that
uses the definitions. We just broke these apart to avoid having a lot of code
and then a lot of explanation, I'd be fine having this be one big listing if
you think that would be better /Carol -->
<p>In listing 15-29, we’re adding a <code>main</code> function that uses the definitions from
Listing 15-28. This code creates a list in <code>a</code>, a list in <code>b</code> that points to
the list in <code>a</code>, and then modifies the list in <code>a</code> to point to <code>b</code>, which
creates a reference cycle. There are <code>println!</code> statements along the way to
show what the reference counts are at various points in this process.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-29: Creating a reference cycle of two <code>List</code>
values pointing to each other</span></p>
<p>We create an <code>Rc</code> instance holding a <code>List</code> value in the variable <code>a</code> with an
initial list of <code>5, Nil</code>. We then create an <code>Rc</code> instance holding another
<code>List</code> value in the variable <code>b</code> that contains the value 10, then points to the
list in <code>a</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, we modify <code>a</code> so that it points to <code>b</code> instead of <code>Nil</code>, which creates
a cycle. We do that by using the <code>tail</code> method to get a reference to the
<code>RefCell</code> in <code>a</code>, which we put in the variable <code>link</code>. Then we use the
<code>borrow_mut</code> method on the <code>RefCell</code> to change the value inside from an <code>Rc</code>
that holds a <code>Nil</code> value to the <code>Rc</code> in <code>b</code>.</p>
<p>If we run this code, keeping the last <code>println!</code> commented out for the moment,
we’ll get this output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">a initial rc count = 1
a next item = Some(RefCell { value: Nil })
a rc count after b creation = 2
b initial rc count = 1
b next item = Some(RefCell { value: Cons(5, RefCell { value: Nil }) })
b rc count after changing a = 2
a rc count after changing a = 2
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that the reference count of the <code>Rc</code> instances in both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
are 2 after we change the list in <code>a</code> to point to <code>b</code>. At the end of <code>main</code>,
Rust will try and drop <code>b</code> first, which will decrease the count in each of the
<code>Rc</code> instances in <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> by one.</p>
<!-- Above -- previously `a` and `b` said `Rc`, I wanted to clarify that by Rc
we mean a and b, is that right? -->
<!-- There's lots of stuff in `a` and `b`; we specifically mean the `Rc` values
here which is why we said `Rc`. I've tried to say both `a` & `b` and `Rc` here
instead, to be most precise. What do you think? /Carol -->
<!-- Below--"that Rc" - what are we referring to, a is still referencing b? Can
you clarify that? -->
<!-- Yes, the `Rc` in `b`. /Carol -->
<p>However, because <code>a</code> is still referencing the <code>Rc</code> that was in <code>b</code>, that <code>Rc</code>
has a count of 1 rather than 0, so the memory the <code>Rc</code> has on the heap won’t be
dropped. The memory will just sit there with a count of one, forever.</p>
<p>To visualize this, we’ve created a reference cycle that looks like Figure 15-30:</p>
<p><img alt="Reference cycle of lists" src="img/trpl15-04.svg" class="center" /></p>
<p><span class="caption">Figure 15-30: A reference cycle of lists <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
pointing to each other</span></p>
<p>If you uncomment the last <code>println!</code> and run the program, Rust will try and
print this cycle out with <code>a</code> pointing to <code>b</code> pointing to <code>a</code> and so forth
until it overflows the stack.</p>
<!-- Can you show us the output? Also, why are we commenting out the print
statement in the first place?-->
<!-- We have the last println commented out to begin with because otherwise you
get a LOT of output until the stack overflows. We thought that would be
confusing and make it harder to see the reference counts we're printing out
before that point. Did you try the code with and without that line commented
out? Which one would make a better first experience when running this code?
/Carol -->
<p>In this specific case, right after we create the reference cycle, the program
ends. The consequences of this cycle aren’t so dire. If a more complex program
allocates lots of memory in a cycle and holds onto it for a long time, the
program would be using more memory than it needs, and might overwhelm the
system and cause it to run out of available memory.</p>
<p>Creating reference cycles is not easily done, but it’s not impossible either.
If you have <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> values that contain <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> values or similar nested
combinations of types with interior mutability and reference counting, be aware
that you have to ensure you don’t create cycles yourself; you can’t rely on
Rust to catch them. Creating a reference cycle would be a logic bug in your
program that you should use automated tests, code reviews, and other software
development practices to minimize.</p>
<!-- Above-- this seems like a vague solution, just not writing the code that
creates cycles, can you be more specific about which part they should
exclude/change? -->
<!-- Not really, this example was deliberately creating a reference cycle, so
if you don't want reference cycles, you shouldn't write this code. It's similar
to a logic bug-- if you want your program to add 2 to a number instead of 50,
then you have to type 2 rather than typing 50. I'm not sure how to be more
specific or helpful here; I've referenced writing tests and other things that
can help mitigate logic bugs. /Carol -->
<p>Another solution is reorganizing your data structures so that some references
express ownership and some references don’t. In this way, we can have cycles
made up of some ownership relationships and some non-ownership relationships,
and only the ownership relationships affect whether a value may be dropped or
not. In Listing 15-28, we always want <code>Cons</code> variants to own their list, so
reorganizing the data structure isn’t possible. Let’s look at an example using
graphs made up of parent nodes and child nodes to see when non-ownership
relationships are an appropriate way to prevent reference cycles.</p>

<p>So far, we’ve shown how calling <code>Rc::clone</code> increases the <code>strong_count</code> of an
<code>Rc</code> instance, and that an <code>Rc</code> instance is only cleaned up if its
<code>strong_count</code> is 0. We can also create a <em>weak reference</em> to the value within
an <code>Rc</code> instance by calling <code>Rc::downgrade</code> and passing a reference to the
<code>Rc</code>. When we call <code>Rc::downgrade</code>, we get a smart pointer of type <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>.
Instead of increasing the <code>strong_count</code> in the <code>Rc</code> instance by one, calling
<code>Rc::downgrade</code> increases the <code>weak_count</code> by one. The <code>Rc</code> type uses
<code>weak_count</code> to keep track of how many <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> references exist, similarly to
<code>strong_count</code>. The difference is the <code>weak_count</code> does not need to be 0 in
order for the <code>Rc</code> instance to be cleaned up.</p>
<!-- What is a weak_count? I don't think we've defined that, or strong_count,
really. Are we just giving another variable to store the count that has no
input on whether memory is dropped? When is a count stored in strong_count and
when is it stored in weak_count? -->
<!-- We're not giving `Rc` another variable, the standard library has defined
`Rc` to have both the `strong_count` and `weak_count` as fields. I've tried to
clarify the paragraph above to address your questions. /Carol -->
<p>Strong references are how we can share ownership of an <code>Rc</code> instance. Weak
references don’t express an ownership relationship. They won’t cause a
reference cycle since any cycle involving some weak references will be broken
once the strong reference count of values involved is 0.</p>
<!-- Below: I'm struggling to follow here, why do we want to get a value from
Weak<T>? This section is losing me somewhat, can you slow this down, make sure
you define anything new up front and give it’s purpose, what we intend it to
do? -->
<!-- I've tried to clarify /Carol -->
<p>Because the value that <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> references might have been dropped, in order
to do anything with the value that a <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> is pointing to, we have to check
to make sure the value is still around. We do this by calling the <code>upgrade</code>
method on a <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> instance, which will return an <code>Option&lt;Rc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>. We’ll get
a result of <code>Some</code> if the <code>Rc</code> value has not been dropped yet, and <code>None</code> if
the <code>Rc</code> value has been dropped. Because <code>upgrade</code> returns an <code>Option</code>, we can
be sure that Rust will handle both the <code>Some</code> case and the <code>None</code> case, and
there won’t be an invalid pointer.</p>
<p>As an example, rather than using a list whose items know only about the next
item, we’ll create a tree whose items know about their children items <em>and</em>
their parent items.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-a-tree-data-structure-a-node-with-child-nodes" id="creating-a-tree-data-structure-a-node-with-child-nodes"><h4>Creating a Tree Data Structure: a <code>Node</code> with Child Nodes</h4></a>
<p>To start building this tree, we’ll create a struct named <code>Node</code> that holds its
own <code>i32</code> value as well as references to its children <code>Node</code> values:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    children: RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;Rc&lt;Node&gt;&gt;&gt;,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We want a <code>Node</code> to own its children, and we want to be able to share that
ownership with variables so we can access each <code>Node</code> in the tree directly. To
do this, we define the <code>Vec</code> items to be values of type <code>Rc&lt;Node&gt;</code>. We also
want to be able to modify which nodes are children of another node, so we have
a <code>RefCell</code> in <code>children</code> around the <code>Vec</code>.</p>
<p>Next, let’s use our struct definition and create one <code>Node</code> instance named
<code>leaf</code> with the value 3 and no children, and another instance named <code>branch</code>
with the value 5 and <code>leaf</code> as one of its children, as shown in Listing 15-31:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let leaf = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 3,
        children: RefCell::new(vec![]),
    });

    let branch = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 5,
        children: RefCell::new(vec![Rc::clone(&amp;leaf)]),
    });
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-31: Creating a <code>leaf</code> node with no children
and a <code>branch</code> node with <code>leaf</code> as one of its children</span></p>
<p>We clone the <code>Rc</code> in <code>leaf</code> and store that in <code>branch</code>, meaning the <code>Node</code> in
<code>leaf</code> now has two owners: <code>leaf</code> and <code>branch</code>. We can get from <code>branch</code> to
<code>leaf</code> through <code>branch.children</code>, but there’s no way to get from <code>leaf</code> to
<code>branch</code>. <code>leaf</code> has no reference to <code>branch</code> and doesn’t know they are
related. We’d like <code>leaf</code> to know that <code>branch</code> is its parent.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#adding-a-reference-from-a-child-to-its-parent" id="adding-a-reference-from-a-child-to-its-parent"><h4>Adding a Reference from a Child to its Parent</h4></a>
<p>To make the child node aware of its parent, we need to add a <code>parent</code> field to
our <code>Node</code> struct definition. The trouble is in deciding what the type of
<code>parent</code> should be. We know it can’t contain an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> because that would
create a reference cycle, with <code>leaf.parent</code> pointing to <code>branch</code> and
<code>branch.children</code> pointing to <code>leaf</code>, which would cause their <code>strong_count</code>
values to never be zero.</p>
<p>Thinking about the relationships another way, a parent node should own its
children: if a parent node is dropped, its child nodes should be dropped as
well. However, a child should not own its parent: if we drop a child node, the
parent should still exist. This is a case for weak references!</p>
<p>So instead of <code>Rc</code>, we’ll make the type of <code>parent</code> use <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>, specifically
a <code>RefCell&lt;Weak&lt;Node&gt;&gt;</code>. Now our <code>Node</code> struct definition looks like this:</p>
<!-- I think because I still don't understand what Weak<T> is, I’m not really
sure what it means for the parent to use Weak<T>, can you make sure that’s
clear at this point -->
<!-- I've tried, I'm not sure though /Carol -->

talk it through -->
<p>Creating the <code>leaf</code> node looks similar to how creating the <code>leaf</code> node looked
in Listing 15-31, with the exception of the <code>parent</code> field: <code>leaf</code> starts out
without a parent, so we create a new, empty <code>Weak</code> reference instance.</p>
<p>At this point, when we try to get a reference to the parent of <code>leaf</code> by using

<!-- I've tried, this will be better with wingdings /Carol -->
<p>When we create the <code>branch</code> node, it will also have a new <code>Weak</code> reference,
since <code>branch</code> does not have a parent node. We still have <code>leaf</code> as one of the
children of <code>branch</code>. Once we have the <code>Node</code> instance in <code>branch</code>, we can
modify <code>leaf</code> to give it a <code>Weak</code> reference to its parent. We use the
<code>borrow_mut</code> method on the <code>RefCell</code> in the <code>parent</code> field of <code>leaf</code>, then we
use the <code>Rc::downgrade</code> function to create a <code>Weak</code> reference to <code>branch</code> from
the <code>Rc</code> in <code>branch.</code></p>
<!-- Below: What does this mean for our program, that now leaf recognizes its
parent? -->
<!-- Yes /Carol -->
<p>When we print out the parent of <code>leaf</code> again, this time we’ll get a <code>Some</code>
variant holding <code>branch</code>: <code>leaf</code> can now access its parent! When we print out
<code>leaf</code>, we also avoid the cycle that eventually ended in a stack overflow like
we had in Listing 15-29: the <code>Weak</code> references are printed as <code>(Weak)</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">leaf parent = Some(Node { value: 5, parent: RefCell { value: (Weak) },

<p>The lack of infinite output indicates that this code didn’t create a reference
cycle. We can also tell this by looking at the values we get from calling

<p><span class="caption">Listing 15-33: Creating <code>branch</code> in an inner scope and
examining strong and weak reference counts</span></p>
<p>Once <code>leaf</code> is created, its <code>Rc</code> has a strong count of 1 and a weak count of 0.
In the inner scope we create <code>branch</code> and associate it with <code>leaf</code>, at which
point the <code>Rc</code> in <code>branch</code> will have a strong count of 1 and a weak count of 1
(for <code>leaf.parent</code> pointing to <code>branch</code> with a <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>). Here <code>leaf</code> will
have a strong count of 2, because <code>branch</code> now has a clone of the <code>Rc</code> of
<code>leaf</code> stored in <code>branch.children</code>, but will still have a weak count of 0.</p>
<p>When the inner scope ends, <code>branch</code> goes out of scope and the strong count of
the <code>Rc</code> decreases to 0, so its <code>Node</code> gets dropped. The weak count of 1 from
<code>leaf.parent</code> has no bearing on whether <code>Node</code> is dropped or not, so we don’t
get any memory leaks!</p>
<p>If we try to access the parent of <code>leaf</code> after the end of the scope, we’ll get
<code>None</code> again. At the end of the program, the <code>Rc</code> in <code>leaf</code> has a strong count
of 1 and a weak count of 0, because the variable <code>leaf</code> is now the only
reference to the <code>Rc</code> again.</p>
<!-- Just to clarify, leaf is pointing to itself? -->
<!-- `leaf` is the variable pointing to the `Rc`, the `Rc` is what has the
strong and weak counts. /Carol -->
<p>All of the logic that manages the counts and value dropping is built in to
<code>Rc</code> and <code>Weak</code> and their implementations of the <code>Drop</code> trait. By specifying
that the relationship from a child to its parent should be a <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>
reference in the definition of <code>Node</code>, we’re able to have parent nodes point to
child nodes and vice versa without creating a reference cycle and memory leaks.</p>
<!-- Ah! This actually cleared up a lot, we specify in the definition that a
reference should be weak and therefore ignored by the Drop trait, is that
right? It would really help to specify that up front, can you add something
like that to the start of the Weak section? -->

<a class="header" href="print.html#summary-13" id="summary-13"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>This chapter covered how you can use smart pointers to make different
guarantees and tradeoffs than those Rust makes by default with regular
references. <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> has a known size and points to data allocated on the heap.
<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> keeps track of the number of references to data on the heap so that
data can have multiple owners. <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> with its interior mutability gives
us a type that can be used when we need an immutable type but need the ability
to change an inner value of that type, and enforces the borrowing rules at
runtime instead of at compile time.</p>
<p>We also discussed the <code>Deref</code> and <code>Drop</code> traits that enable a lot of the
functionality of smart pointers. We explored reference cycles that can cause
memory leaks, and how to prevent them using <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>If this chapter has piqued your interest and you want to implement your own
smart pointers, check out <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nomicon/">“The Nomicon”</a> for even more useful information.</p>
<p>Next, let’s talk about concurrency in Rust. We’ll even learn about a few new
smart pointers.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#fearless-concurrency" id="fearless-concurrency"><h1>Fearless Concurrency</h1></a>
<p>Handling concurrent programming safely and efficiently is another of Rust’s
major goals. <em>Concurrent programming</em>, where different parts of a program
execute independently, and <em>parallel programming</em>, where different parts of a
program are executing at the same time, are becoming increasingly important as
more computers have multiple processors to take advantage of. Historically,
programming in these contexts has been difficult and error prone: Rust hopes to
change that.</p>
<p>Initially, the Rust team thought that ensuring memory safety and preventing
concurrency problems were two separate challenges to be solved with different
methods. Over time, they discovered that the ownership and type systems are a
powerful set of tools to help in dealing with both memory safety <em>and</em>
concurrency problems! By leveraging ownership and type checking, many
concurrency errors are <em>compile time</em> errors in Rust, rather than runtime
errors. Rather than spending lots of time trying to reproduce the exact
circumstances under which a runtime concurrency bug occurs, incorrect code will
refuse to compile with an error explaining the problem. This lets you fix your
code while you’re working on it, rather than potentially after it’s been
shipped to production. We’ve nicknamed this aspect of Rust <em>fearless
concurrency</em>. Fearless concurrency allows you to write code that’s free of
subtle bugs and is easy to refactor without introducing new bugs.</p>
<!-- Can you say explicitly why making concurrency issues compile time errors
rather than runtime errors is an advantage? -->
<!-- I feel like we've explained this a few times now, but I suppose since the
advantage should be greater in concurrent code it's worth saying again /Carol
-->
<blockquote>
<p>Note: we’ll be referring to many of the problems here as <em>concurrent</em> rather
than being more precise by saying <em>concurrent and/or parallel</em>, for
simplicity’s sake. If this were a book specifically about concurrency and/or
parallelism, we’d be sure to be more specific. For this chapter, please
mentally substitute <em>concurrent and/or parallel</em> whenever we say <em>concurrent</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- I'm not sure what you mean about languages being strongly opinionated over
these issues and what kind of strategy that is, below, can you be more
specific? -->
<!-- I've added an example and elaborated on the strategy we're talking about
here. /Carol -->
<p>Many languages are strongly opinionated about the solutions they offer for
dealing with concurrent problems. For example, Erlang has elegant functionality
for message passing concurrency, but only obscure ways to share state between
threads. Only supporting a subset of possible solutions is a reasonable
strategy for higher-level languages to take, because a higher-level language
promises benefits from giving up some control in order to gain abstractions.
However, lower-level languages are expected to provide the solution with the
best performance in any given situation, and have fewer abstractions over the
hardware. Rust, therefore, gives us a variety of tools for modeling your
problems in whatever way is appropriate for your situation and requirements.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’ll cover in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create threads to run multiple pieces of code at the same time</li>
<li><em>Message passing</em> concurrency, where channels are used to send messages
between threads.</li>
<li><em>Shared state</em> concurrency, where multiple threads have access to some piece
of data.</li>
<li>The <code>Sync</code> and <code>Send</code> traits, which extend Rust’s concurrency guarantees to
user-defined types as well as types provided by the standard library.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-threads-to-run-code-simultaneously" id="using-threads-to-run-code-simultaneously"><h2>Using Threads to Run Code Simultaneously</h2></a>
<p>In most operating systems today, an executed program’s code is run in a
<em>process</em>, and the operating system manages multiple process at once. Within
your program, you can also have independent parts that run simultaneously. The
feature that runs these independent parts is called <em>threads</em>.</p>
<!-- I've tried to simplify the text above, can you check that I haven't
changed meaning? -->
<!-- Made some small tweaks, overall seems fine /Carol -->
<p>Splitting the computation in your program up into multiple threads can improve
performance, since the program will be doing multiple things at the same time,
but it also adds complexity. Because threads may run simultaneously, there’s no
inherent guarantee about the order in which parts of your code on different
threads will run. This can lead to problems such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Race conditions, where threads are accessing data or resources in an
inconsistent order</li>
<li>Deadlocks, where two threads are waiting for each other to finish using a
resource the other thread has, which prevents both threads from continuing</li>
<li>Bugs that only happen in certain situations and are hard to reproduce and
fix reliably</li>
</ul>
<!-- How do threads prevent each other from continuing? Or is that something
we'll cover later?-->
<!-- We don't really get into that later, so I've expanded a bit here /Carol -->
<p>Rust attempts to mitigate negative effects of using threads. Programming in a
multithreaded context still takes careful thought and requires a code structure
that’s different from programs that run in a single thread.</p>
<p>Programming languages implement threads in a few different ways. Many operating
systems provide an API for creating new threads. This model where a language
calls the operating system APIs to create threads is sometimes called <em>1:1</em>,
one OS thread per one language thread.</p>
<p>Many programming languages provide their own special implementation of threads.
Programming language-provided threads are known as <em>green</em> threads, and
languages that use these green threads will execute them in the context of a
different number of operating system threads. For this reason, the green
threaded model is called the <em>M:N</em> model, <code>M</code> green threads per <code>N</code> OS threads,
where <code>M</code> and <code>N</code> are not necessarily the same number.</p>
<p>Each model has its own advantages and tradeoffs, and the tradeoff most
important to Rust is runtime support. <em>Runtime</em> is a confusing term and can
have different meanings in different contexts.</p>
<!-- Below - you mean this is the cause of runtime? Or "runtime" literally
means the code included by Rust in every binary? -->
<!-- Runtime literally means the code included by Rust in every binary.
Wikipedia calls this "runtime system":
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system but most people colloquially just
say "the runtime". I've tried to clarify. /Carol -->
<p>In this context, by runtime we mean code that’s included by the language in
every binary. This code can be large or small depending on the language, but
every non-assembly language will have some amount of runtime code. For that
reason, colloquially when people say a language has “no runtime” they often
mean “small runtime.” Smaller runtimes have fewer features but have the
advantage of resulting in smaller binaries, which make it easier to combine the
language with other languages in more contexts. While many languages are okay
with increasing the runtime size in exchange for more features, Rust needs to
have nearly no runtime, and cannot compromise on being able to call into C in
order to maintain performance.</p>
<p>The green threading M:N model requires a larger language runtime to manage
threads. As such, the Rust standard library only provides an implementation of
1:1 threading. Because Rust is such a low-level language, there are crates that
implement M:N threading if you would rather trade overhead for aspects such as
more control over which threads run when and lower costs of context switching,
for example.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve defined threads in Rust, let’s explore how to use the
thread-related API provided by the standard library.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-a-new-thread-with-spawn" id="creating-a-new-thread-with-spawn"><h3>Creating a New Thread with <code>spawn</code></h3></a>
<p>To create a new thread, we call the <code>thread::spawn</code> function, and pass it a
closure (we talked about closures in Chapter 13) containing the code we want to
run in the new thread. The example in Listing 16-1 prints some text from a main
thread and other text from a new thread:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

    thread::spawn(|| {

            println!(&quot;hi number {} from the spawned thread!&quot;, i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });

    for i in 1..5 {
        println!(&quot;hi number {} from the main thread!&quot;, i);
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-1: Creating a new thread to print one thing
while the main thread prints something else</span></p>
<p>Note that with this function, the new thread will be stopped when the main
thread ends, whether it has finished running or not. The output from this
program might be a little different every time, but it will look similar to
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">hi number 1 from the main thread!
hi number 1 from the spawned thread!
hi number 2 from the main thread!
hi number 2 from the spawned thread!
hi number 3 from the main thread!

hi number 4 from the main thread!
hi number 4 from the spawned thread!
hi number 5 from the spawned thread!
</code></pre>
<!-- This seems interesting, how come the threads often take turns, but not
always? -->
<!-- I've added a bit of clarification /Carol -->
<p>The <code>thread::sleep</code> function will force a thread to stop its execution for a
short duration, allowing a different thread to run, so that they will probably
take turns, but that’s not guaranteed: it depends on how your operating system
schedules the threads. In this run, the main thread printed first, even though
the print statement from the spawned thread appears first in the code. And even
though we told the spawned thread to print until <code>i</code> is 9, it only got to 5
before the main thread shut down.</p>
<p>If you run this code and only see one thread, or don’t see any overlap, try
increasing the numbers in the ranges to create more opportunities for a thread
to take a break and give the other thread a turn.</p>

<p>The code in Listing 16-1 not only stops the spawned thread prematurely most of
the time, because the main thread ends before the spawned thread is done,
there’s actually no guarantee that the spawned thread will get to run at all,
because there’s no guarantee on the order in which threads run!</p>
<!-- Above -- why is this the case, because there are no guarantees over which
order the threads run in? -->
<!-- Yep! /Carol -->
<p>We can fix this by saving the return value of <code>thread::spawn</code> in a variable.
The return type of <code>thread::spawn</code> is <code>JoinHandle</code>. A <code>JoinHandle</code> is an owned
value that, when we call the <code>join</code> method on it, will wait for its thread to
finish. Listing 16-2 shows how to use the <code>JoinHandle</code> of the thread we created
in Listing 16-1 and call <code>join</code> in order to make sure the spawned thread
finishes before the <code>main</code> exits:</p>
<!-- Saving the return value where? I think this explanation of join handle
needs expanding, this feels cut short -->

seems missing, so I'm not sure if this is sufficient /Carol -->

<p>Calling <code>join</code> on the handle blocks the thread currently running until the
thread represented by the handle terminates. <em>Blocking</em> a thread means that
thread is prevented from performing work or exiting. Because we’ve put the call
to <code>join</code> after the main thread’s <code>for</code> loop, running this example should
produce output that looks something like this:</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#using-move-closures-with-threads" id="using-move-closures-with-threads"><h3>Using <code>move</code> Closures with Threads</h3></a>
<p>The <code>move</code> closure, which we didn’t cover in Chapter 13, is often used
alongside <code>thread::spawn</code>, as it allows us to use data from one thread in
another thread.</p>
<p>In Chapter 13, we said that “Creating closures that capture values from their
environment is mostly used in the context of starting new threads.”</p>
<!-- PROD: DE to check this quote, see if it has changed -->
<p>Now we’re creating new threads, so let’s talk about capturing values in
closures!</p>
<p>Notice in Listing 16-1 that the closure we pass to <code>thread::spawn</code> takes no
arguments: we’re not using any data from the main thread in the spawned
thread’s code. In order to do so, the spawned thread’s closure must capture the
values it needs. Listing 16-3 shows an attempt to create a vector in the main
thread and use it in the spawned thread. However, this won’t yet work, as
you’ll see in a moment:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        println!(&quot;Here's a vector: {:?}&quot;, v);
    });

    handle.join();
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-3: Attempting to use a vector created by the
main thread in another thread</span></p>
<p>The closure uses <code>v</code>, so will capture <code>v</code> and make it part of the closure’s
environment. Because <code>thread::spawn</code> runs this closure in a new thread, we
should be able to access <code>v</code> inside that new thread.</p>
<p>When we compile this example, however, we’ll get the following error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0373]: closure may outlive the current function, but it borrows `v`,
which is owned by the current function

  |
help: to force the closure to take ownership of `v` (and any other referenced
variables), use the `move` keyword, as shown:
  |     let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
</code></pre>
<p>Rust <em>infers</em> how to capture <code>v</code>, and since <code>println!</code> only needs a reference
to <code>v</code>, the closure tries to borrow <code>v</code>. There’s a problem, though: Rust can’t
tell how long the spawned thread will run, so doesn’t know if the reference to
<code>v</code> will always be valid.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a scenario that’s more likely to have a reference to <code>v</code> that
won’t be valid, shown Listing 16-4:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        println!(&quot;Here's a vector: {:?}&quot;, v);
    });

    drop(v); // oh no!

    handle.join();
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-4: A thread with a closure that attempts to
capture a reference to <code>v</code> from a main thread that drops <code>v</code></span></p>
<p>If we run this code, there’s a possibility the spawned thread will be
immediately put in the background without getting a chance to run at all. The
spawned thread has a reference to <code>v</code> inside, but the main thread immediately
drops <code>v</code>, using the <code>drop</code> function we discussed in Chapter 15. Then, when the
spawned thread starts to execute, <code>v</code> is no longer valid, so a reference to it
is also invalid. Oh no!</p>
<p>To fix the problem in Listing 16-3, we can listen to the advice of the error
message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">help: to force the closure to take ownership of `v` (and any other referenced
variables), use the `move` keyword, as shown:
  |     let handle = thread::spawn(move || {

<p>By adding the <code>move</code> keyword before the closure, we force the closure to take
ownership of the values it’s using, rather than allowing Rust to infer that it
should borrow. The modification to Listing 16-3 shown in Listing 16-5 will
compile and run as we intend:</p>

    });

    handle.join();
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-5: Using the <code>move</code> keyword to force a closure

<!-- Can you be more specific about the question we're asking about 16-4?-->
<!-- Done /Carol -->
<p>What would happen to the code in Listing 16-4 where the main thread called
<code>drop</code> if we use a <code>move</code> closure? Would <code>move</code> fix that case? Nope, we get a
different error, because what Listing 16-4 is trying to do isn’t allowed for a
different reason! If we add <code>move</code> to the closure, we’d move <code>v</code> into the
closure’s environment, and we could no longer call <code>drop</code> on it in the main
thread. We would get this compiler error instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0382]: use of moved value: `v`
  --&gt;
   |
6  |     let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
   |                                ------- value moved (into closure) here
...
10 |     drop(v); // oh no!
   |          ^ value used here after move
   |
   = note: move occurs because `v` has type `std::vec::Vec&lt;i32&gt;`, which does
   not implement the `Copy` trait
</code></pre>
<p>Rust’s ownership rules have saved us again! We got an error from the code in
Listing 16-3 because Rust was being conservative and only borrowing <code>v</code> for the
thread, which meant the main thread could theoretically invalidate the spawned
thread’s reference. By telling Rust to move ownership of <code>v</code> to the spawned
thread, we’re guaranteeing to Rust that the main thread won’t use <code>v</code> anymore.
If we change Listing 16-4 in the same way, we’re then violating the ownership
rules when we try to use <code>v</code> in the main thread. The <code>move</code> keyword overrides
Rust’s conservative default of borrowing; it doesn’t let us violate the
ownership rules.</p>
<!-- Uh oh, I'm lost again, I thought we were trying to fix 16-4 with move, but
we don't want it to work, is that right? Can you talk about this a little?-->
<!-- I've tried to clarify a bit in the paragraph before this error and a bit
after the error /Carol -->
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of threads and the thread API, let’s
talk about what we can actually <em>do</em> with threads.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#message-passing-to-transfer-data-between-threads" id="message-passing-to-transfer-data-between-threads"><h2>Message Passing to Transfer Data Between Threads</h2></a>
<p>One increasingly popular approach to ensuring safe concurrency is <em>message
passing</em>, where threads or actors communicate by sending each other messages
containing data. Here’s the idea in slogan form from the Go language
documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by
communicating.</p>
<p>--<a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">Effective Go</a></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- below -- what is the channel, precisely? A crate? a technique?-->
<!-- I've elaborated /Carol -->
<p>One major tool Rust has for accomplishing message sending concurrency is the
<em>channel</em>, a programming concept that Rust’s standard library provides an
implementation of. You can imagine a channel in programming like a channel of
water, such as a stream or a river. If you put something like a rubber duck or
a boat into a stream, it will travel downstream to the end of the river.</p>
<p>A channel in programming has two halves: a transmitter and a receiver. The
transmitter half is like the upstream location where we put rubber ducks into
the river, and the receiver half is the downstream place where the rubber duck
ends up. One part of our code calls methods on the transmitter with the data we
want to send, and another part checks the receiving end for arriving messages.</p>
<p>Here we’ll work up to a program that has one thread to generate values and send
them down a channel, and another thread that will receive the values and print
them out. We’re going to be sending simple values between threads using a
channel for the purposes of illustration. Once you’re familiar with the
technique, you could use channels to implement a chat system, or a system where
many threads perform parts of a calculation and send the parts to one thread
that aggregates the results.</p>
<p>First, we’ll create a channel but not do anything with it in Listing 16-6:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">use std::sync::mpsc;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
#     tx.send(()).unwrap();
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-6: Creating a channel and assigning the two
halves to <code>tx</code> and <code>rx</code></span></p>
<p>We create a new channel using the <code>mpsc::channel</code> function; <code>mpsc</code> stands for
<em>multiple producer, single consumer</em>. In short, the way Rust’s standard library
has implemented channels is such that a channel can have multiple <em>sending</em>
ends that produce values, but only one <em>receiving</em> end that consumes those
values. Imagine multiple rivers and streams flowing together into one big
river: everything sent down any of the streams will end up in one river at the
end. We’re going to start with a single producer for now, but we’ll add
multiple producers once we get this example working.</p>
<!-- NEXT PARAGRAPH WRAPPED WEIRD INTENTIONALLY SEE #199 -->
<p>The <code>mpsc::channel</code> function returns a tuple, the first element of which is the
sending end and the second element the receiving end. The abbreviations <code>tx</code>
and <code>rx</code> are traditionally used in many fields for <em>transmitter</em> and <em>receiver</em>
respectively, so we give our variables those names to indicate each end. We’re
using a <code>let</code> statement with a pattern that destructures the tuples; we’ll be
discussing the use of patterns in <code>let</code> statements and destructuring in
Chapter 18. Using a <code>let</code> statement in this way is a convenient way to extract
the pieces of the tuple returned by <code>mpsc::channel</code>.</p>
<!-- above -- can you give us a general idea of what that means for us in this
program? -->
<!-- A general idea of what *what* means? I'm not sure what you're asking for;
I've added a bit of explanation of the destructuring but I'm not sure that's
what you meant /Carol -->
<p>Let’s move the transmitting end into a spawned thread and have it send one
string so that the spawned thread is communicating with the main thread, shown
in Listing 16-7. This is like putting a rubber duck in the river upstream or
sending a chat message from one thread to another:</p>
<!-- Can you tell us why we want to do this, what does this do for us and our
program? -->
<!-- Elaborated /Carol -->
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let val = String::from(&quot;hi&quot;);
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
    });
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-7: Moving <code>tx</code> to a spawned thread and sending
“hi”</span></p>
<p>We’re again using <code>thread::spawn</code> to create a new thread, and then use <code>move</code>
to move <code>tx</code> into the closure so the spawned thread owns <code>tx</code>. The spawned
thread needs to own the transmitting end of the channel in order to be able to
send messages through the channel.</p>
<p>The transmitting end has a <code>send</code> method that takes the value we want to send.
The <code>send</code> method returns a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> type, so that if the receiving end
has already been dropped and there’s nowhere to send a value, the send
operation will error. In this example, we’re simply calling <code>unwrap</code> to panic
in case of error, but for a real application, we’d handle it properly--return
to Chapter 9 to review strategies for proper error handling.</p>
<p>In Listing 16-8, we’ll get the value from the receiving end of the channel in
the main thread. This is like retrieving the rubber duck from the water at the
end of the river, or like getting a chat message:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let val = String::from(&quot;hi&quot;);
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
    });

    let received = rx.recv().unwrap();
    println!(&quot;Got: {}&quot;, received);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-8: Receiving the value “hi” in the main thread
and printing it out</span></p>
<p>The receiving end of a channel has two useful methods: <code>recv</code> and <code>try_recv</code>.
We’re using <code>recv</code>, short for <em>receive</em>, which will block the main thread’s
execution and wait until a value is sent down the channel. Once a value is
sent, <code>recv</code> will return it in a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>. When the sending end of the
channel closes, <code>recv</code> will return an error to signal that no more values will
be coming.</p>
<!-- Why do we want it to error when the sending end closes? And what's the
advantage of blocking here? -->
<!-- We don't necessarily *want* it to error, that's just how the standard
library has implemented it. I've tried to clarify that and blocking. /Carol -->
<p>The <code>try_recv</code> method doesn’t block, but will instead return a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>
immediately: an <code>Ok</code> value holding a message if one is available, and an <code>Err</code>
value if there aren’t any messages this time. Using <code>try_recv</code> is useful if
this thread has other work to do while waiting for messages: we could write a
loop that calls <code>try_recv</code> every so often, handles a message if one is
available, and otherwise does other work for a little while until checking
again.</p>
<p>We’ve chosen to use <code>recv</code> in this example for simplicity; we don’t have any
other work for the main thread to do other than wait for messages, so blocking
the main thread is appropriate.</p>
<!-- So what is the difference here, what are the different situations you
would want to return the value immediately? -->
<!-- Elaborated above /Carol -->
<p>If we run the code in Listing 16-8, we’ll see the value printed out from the
main thread:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Got: hi
</code></pre>
<p>Perfect!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#channels-and-ownership-transference" id="channels-and-ownership-transference"><h3>Channels and Ownership Transference</h3></a>
<!-- Hmm i'm not sure we need as it's own section, it seems like it could be
condensed now the reader is pretty familiar with ownership rules. We might not
even need the example, but I'll defer to you on this -->
<!-- We think the examples in this section are important-- there are likely
readers who are skeptical about Rust's ownership system and whether it's worth
putting up with, and this section is the payoff. We're trying to convince those
people that one big benefit Rust's ownership gives you is that it enables you
to write safe, concurrent code. I'm glad we've convinced *you*, but I'm not so
sure that we'll have convinced all our readers at this point! I've tried to
state this a bit more clearly without calling out these readers too
explicitly... /Carol -->
<p>The ownership rules play a vital role in message sending as far as helping us
write safe, concurrent code. Preventing errors in concurrent programming is the
advantage we get by making the tradeoff of having to think about ownership
throughout our Rust programs. Let’s do an experiment to show how channels and
ownership work together to prevent problems: we’ll try to use a <code>val</code> value in
the spawned thread <em>after</em> we’ve sent it down the channel. Try compiling the
code in Listing 16-9:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let val = String::from(&quot;hi&quot;);
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
        println!(&quot;val is {}&quot;, val);
    });

    let received = rx.recv().unwrap();
    println!(&quot;Got: {}&quot;, received);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-9: Attempting to use <code>val</code> after we have sent
it down the channel</span></p>
<p>Here, we try to print out <code>val</code> after we’ve sent it down the channel via
<code>tx.send</code>. Allowing this would be a bad idea: once the value has been sent to
another thread, that thread could modify or drop it before we try to use the
value again, which would potentially cause errors or unexpected results due to
inconsistent or nonexistent data.</p>
<p>However, Rust gives us an error if we try to compile this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0382]: use of moved value: `val`
  --&gt; src/main.rs:10:31

   |
   = note: move occurs because `val` has type `std::string::String`, which does
   not implement the `Copy` trait
</code></pre>
<p>Our concurrency mistake has caused a compile-time error! The <code>send</code> function
takes ownership of its parameter, and when the value is moved the receiver
takes ownership of it. This stops us from accidentally using the value again
after sending it; the ownership system checks that everything is okay.</p>

<p>The code in Listing 16-8 compiled and ran, but doesn’t show us very clearly
that two separate threads are talking to each other over the channel. In
Listing 16-10 we’ve made some modifications that will prove this code is

<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-10: Sending multiple messages and pausing

<p>This time, the spawned thread has a vector of strings that we want to send to

between each by calling the <code>thread::sleep</code> function with a <code>Duration</code> value of
one second.</p>
<p>In the main thread, we’re not calling the <code>recv</code> function explicitly anymore:

<p>Near the start of this section, we mentioned that <code>mpsc</code> stood for <em>multiple
producer, single consumer</em>. Let’s put that ability to use and expand the code
from Listing 16-10 to create multiple threads that all send values to the same
receiver. We can do that by cloning the transmitting half of the channel, as
shown in Listing 16-11:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

let tx1 = mpsc::Sender::clone(&amp;tx);
thread::spawn(move || {
    let vals = vec![
        String::from(&quot;hi&quot;),
        String::from(&quot;from&quot;),

        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
    }
});

<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-11: Sending multiple messages from multiple
producers</span></p>
<p>This time, before we create the first spawned thread, we call <code>clone</code> on the
sending end of the channel. This will give us a new sending handle we can pass
to the first spawned thread. We pass the original sending end of the channel to
a second spawned thread. This gives us two threads, each sending different
messages to the receiving end of the channel.</p>
<p>If you run this, you’ll <em>probably</em> see output like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Got: hi
Got: more
Got: from
Got: messages
Got: for
Got: the
Got: thread
Got: you
</code></pre>
<p>You might see the values in a different order, it depends on your system! This
is what makes concurrency interesting as well as difficult. If you play around
with <code>thread::sleep</code>, giving it different values in the different threads, each
run will be more non-deterministic and create different output each time.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve seen how channels work, let’s look at a different method of
concurrency.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#shared-state-concurrency" id="shared-state-concurrency"><h2>Shared State Concurrency</h2></a>
<p>Message passing is a fine way of dealing with concurrency, but it’s not the
only one. Consider this slogan again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by
communicating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What would “communicate by sharing memory” look like? And moreover, why would
message passing enthusiasts choose not to use it and do the opposite instead?</p>
<!-- Can you expand here? I wasn't sure where we were getting the idea that
message passers hated and inverted memory sharing -->
<!-- I'm not sure where you got "hate" from :) I've tried to reword. We're
getting this idea from the slogan that the Go programming language espouses
that we discussed earlier /Carol -->
<p>In a way, channels in any programming language are sort of like single
ownership, because once you transfer a value down a channel, you shouldn’t use
that value any longer. Shared memory concurrency is sort of like multiple
ownership: multiple threads can access the same memory location at the same
time. As we saw in Chapter 15 where multiple ownership was made possible by
smart pointers, multiple ownership can add additional complexity because these
different owners need managing.</p>
<p>Rust’s type system and ownership rules assist a lot in getting this management
correct, though. For an example, let’s look at one of the more common
concurrency primitives for shared memory: mutexes.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#mutexes-allow-access-to-data-from-one-thread-at-a-time" id="mutexes-allow-access-to-data-from-one-thread-at-a-time"><h3>Mutexes Allow Access to Data from One Thread at a Time</h3></a>
<p>A <em>mutex</em> is a concurrency primitive for sharing memory. It’s short for “mutual
exclusion”, as in, it only allows one thread to access some data at any given
time. In order to access the data in a mutex, a thread must first signal that
it wants access by asking to acquire the mutex’s <em>lock</em>. The lock is a data
structure that is part of the mutex that keeps track of who currently has
exclusive access to the data. We therefore describe the mutex as <em>guarding</em> the
data it holds via the locking system.</p>
<p>Mutexes have a reputation for being hard to use because there are some
rules you have to remember:</p>
<!-- below -- what is the lock, here? Can you define that outright? And make it
clear that the mutex is the guard? -->
<!-- I've added definitions/explanations above /Carol -->
<ol>
<li>You must attempt to acquire the lock before using the data.</li>
<li>Once you’re done with the data that’s guarded by the mutex, you must unlock
the data so other threads can acquire the lock.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a real-world metaphor of a mutex, imagine a panel discussion at a
conference with only one microphone. Before a panelist may speak, they have to
ask or signal that they would like to use the microphone. Once they get the
microphone, they may talk for as long as they would like, then hand the
microphone to the next panelist who requests to speak. If a panelist forgets to
hand the microphone off when they’re finished with it, no one else is able to
speak. If management of the shared microphone goes wrong, the panel would not
work as planned!</p>
<p>Management of mutexes can be incredibly tricky to get right, and that’s why so
many people are enthusiastic about channels. However, thanks to Rust’s type
system and ownership rules, we can’t get locking and unlocking wrong.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-api-of-mutext" id="the-api-of-mutext"><h4>The API of <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code></h4></a>
<p>Let’s start simply with an example of using a mutex in a single-threaded
context, shown in Listing 16-12:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let m = Mutex::new(5);

    {
        let mut num = m.lock().unwrap();
        *num = 6;
    }

    println!(&quot;m = {:?}&quot;, m);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-12: Exploring the API of <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> in a
single threaded context for simplicity</span></p>
<p>As with many types, we create a <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> using the associated function <code>new</code>.
To access the data inside the mutex, we use the <code>lock</code> method to acquire the
lock. This call will block the current thread so that it can’t do any work
until it’s our turn to have the lock.</p>
<!-- will block what, other requests for the lock? Or block access to the data?
-->
<!-- This is where I hope our earlier definition of "block" that I added will
help; I've also reworded to reinforce that /Carol -->
<p>The call to <code>lock</code> would fail if another thread holding the lock panicked. In
that case, no one would ever be able to get the lock, so we’ve chosen to
<code>unwrap</code> and have this thread panic if we’re in that situation.</p>
<!-- As in, the lock would be released? What would failure look like? -->
<!-- As in we wouldn't ever be able to get the lock, I've clarified /Carol -->
<p>Once we’ve acquired the lock, we can treat the return value, named <code>num</code> in
this case, as a mutable reference to the data inside. The type system ensures
that we acquire a lock before using this value: <code>Mutex&lt;i32&gt;</code> is not an <code>i32</code>,
so we <em>must</em> acquire the lock in order to be able to use the <code>i32</code> value. We
can’t forget; the type system won’t let us do it otherwise.</p>
<p>As you may suspect, <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> is a smart pointer. More accurately, the call to
<code>lock</code> <em>returns</em> a smart pointer called <code>MutexGuard</code>. This smart pointer
implements <code>Deref</code> to point at our inner data, and also has a <code>Drop</code>
implementation that releases the lock automatically when <code>MutexGuard</code> goes out
of scope, which happens at the end of the inner scope in Listing 16-12. This
way, we don’t risk forgetting to release the lock and blocking it from use by
other threads, because it happens automatically.</p>
<p>After dropping the lock, we can print out the mutex value and see that we were
able to change the inner <code>i32</code> to 6.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#sharing-a-mutext-between-multiple-threads" id="sharing-a-mutext-between-multiple-threads"><h4>Sharing a <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> Between Multiple Threads</h4></a>
<p>Let’s now try to share a value between multiple threads using <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>. We’ll
spin up ten threads, and have them each increment a counter value by 1 so that
the counter goes from 0 to 10. Note that the next few examples will have
compiler errors, and we’re going to use those errors to learn more about using
<code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> and how Rust helps us use it correctly. Listing 16-13 has our
starting example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Mutex::new(0);
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();

            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!(&quot;Result: {}&quot;, *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 16-13: Ten threads each increment a counter
guarded by a <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code></span></p>
<p>We’re creating a <code>counter</code> variable to hold an <code>i32</code> inside a <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>, like
we did in Listing 16-12. Next, we’re creating 10 threads by mapping over a
range of numbers. We use <code>thread::spawn</code> and give all the threads the same
closure, one that moves the counter into the thread, acquires a lock on the
<code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> by calling the <code>lock</code> method, and then adds 1 to the value in the
mutex. When a thread finishes running its closure, <code>num</code> will go out of scope
and release the lock so another thread can acquire it.</p>
<p>In the main thread, we collect all the join handles like we did in Listing
16-2, and then call <code>join</code> on each to make sure all the threads finish. At that
point, the main thread will acquire the lock and print out the result of this
program.</p>
<p>We hinted that this example won’t compile, now let’s find out why!</p>
<!-- Hm, since we already saw this error, where we need to include move, maybe
we could skip it here and just include move in the initial program, to focus
more on the new error and new concepts -- what do you think? -->

<p>Let’s reason this out by simplifying the program. Instead of making 10 threads

error: aborting due to 2 previous errors
</code></pre>
<p>Aha! The first error message tells us that <code>counter</code> is moved into the closure
for the thread associated with <code>handle</code>. That move is preventing us from
capturing <code>counter</code> when we try to call <code>lock</code> on it and store the result in
<code>num2</code> in the second thread! So Rust is telling us that we can’t move ownership
of <code>counter</code> into multiple threads. This was hard to see before because our
threads were in a loop, and Rust can’t point to different threads in different
iterations of the loop. Let’s try to fix this with a multiple-ownership method
we saw in Chapter 15.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#multiple-ownership-with-multiple-threads" id="multiple-ownership-with-multiple-threads"><h4>Multiple Ownership with Multiple Threads</h4></a>
<p>In Chapter 15, we were able to give a value multiple owners by using the smart
pointer <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> to create a reference-counted value. Let’s try to do the same
here and see what happens. We’ll wrap the <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> in <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> in Listing
16-14, and clone the <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> before moving ownership to the thread. Now we’ve
seen the errors, we’ll also switch back to using the <code>for</code> loop, and we’ll keep

<p>Wow, that’s quite wordy! Here are some important parts to pick out: the first
note says <code>Rc&lt;Mutex&lt;i32&gt;&gt; cannot be sent between threads safely</code>. The reason
for this is in the error message, which, once distilled, says <code>the trait bound Send is not satisfied</code>. We’re going to talk about <code>Send</code> in the next section;
it’s one of the traits that ensures the types we use with threads are meant for
use in concurrent situations.</p>
<!-- Maybe we need to save this discussion until after talking about Send?
Otherwise, you might expand on this, what is the reader taking away here? -->
<!-- The reader should take away that we can't use `Rc<T>` with threads, and
we're not sure how to point that out without mentioning `Send`. /Carol -->
<p>Unfortunately, <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is not safe to share across threads. When <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>
manages the reference count, it adds to the count for each call to <code>clone</code> and
subtracts from the count when each clone is dropped, but it doesn’t use any
concurrency primitives to make sure that changes to the count can’t be
interrupted by another thread. This could lead to wrong counts: subtle bugs
that could in turn lead to memory leaks or a value being dropped before we’re
done with it. What we need is a type exactly like <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, but that makes
changes to the reference count in a thread-safe way.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#atomic-reference-counting-with-arct" id="atomic-reference-counting-with-arct"><h4>Atomic Reference Counting with <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></h4></a>
<p>Luckily for us, there <em>is</em> a type like <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> that’s safe to use in concurrent
situations: <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code>. The ‘a’ stands for <em>atomic</em>, meaning it’s an <em>atomically
reference counted</em> type. Atomics are an additional kind of concurrency
primitive that we won’t cover in detail here; see the standard library
documentation for <code>std::sync::atomic</code> for more details. What you need to know
here is that atomics work like primitive types, but are safe to share across
threads.</p>
<p>You might then wonder why all primitive types aren’t atomic, and why standard
library types aren’t implemented to use <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> by default. The reason is that
thread safety comes with a performance penalty that you only want to pay when
you really need to. If you’re only doing operations on values within a single
thread, your code can run faster if it doesn’t have to enforce the guarantees
atomics provide.</p>
<p>Back to our example: <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> have the same API, so we fix our
program by changing the <code>use</code> line and the call to <code>new</code>. The code in Listing

<p>We did it! We counted from 0 to 10, which may not seem very impressive, but it
did teach us a lot about <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> and thread safety! This structure could
also be used to do more complicated operations than just incrementing a
counter: these methods allow us to divide calculations up into independent
parts, which we could split across threads, and then we can use a <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> to
have each thread update the final result with its part.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that <code>counter</code> is immutable but we could get a mutable
reference to the value inside it; this means <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> provides interior
mutability, like the <code>Cell</code> family does. In the same way we used <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>
in Chapter 15 to allow us to mutate contents inside an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, we use
<code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> to mutate contents inside of an <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that Rust can’t prevent us from all kinds of logic
errors when using <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>. Recall from Chapter 15 that using <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> came
with the risk of creating reference cycles, where two <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> values refer to
each other, causing memory leaks. Similarly, <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> comes the risk of
<em>deadlocks</em>. These occur when an operation needs to lock two resources and two
threads have each acquired one of the locks, causing them to wait for each
other forever. If you’re interested in this topic, try creating a Rust program
that has a deadlock, then research deadlock mitigation strategies for mutexes
in any language, and have a go at implementing them in Rust. The standard
library API documentation for <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>MutexGuard</code> will have useful
information.</p>
<!--Rust's type system and ownership has made sure that our threads have

that might be spent trying to reproduce subtly incorrect scenarios that only

if we cloned an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> value and tried to transfer ownership of the clone to
another thread, both threads might update the reference count at the same time.
For this reason, <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is implemented for use in single-threaded situations
where you don’t want to pay the threadsafe performance penalty.</p>
<p>In this way Rust’s type system and trait bounds ensure we can never
accidentally send an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> value across threads unsafely. When we tried to do
this in Listing 16-14, we got an error that said <code>the trait Send is not implemented for Rc&lt;Mutex&lt;i32&gt;&gt;</code>. When we switched to <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code>, which is <code>Send</code>,
the code compiled.</p>
<p>Any type composed entirely of <code>Send</code> types is automatically marked as <code>Send</code> as
well. Almost all primitive types are <code>Send</code>, aside from raw pointers, which
we’ll discuss in Chapter 19.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#allowing-access-from-multiple-threads-with-sync" id="allowing-access-from-multiple-threads-with-sync"><h3>Allowing Access from Multiple Threads with <code>Sync</code></h3></a>
<p>The <code>Sync</code> marker trait indicates that it is safe for the type implementing
<code>Sync</code> to be referenced from multiple threads. Another way to say this is that
any type <code>T</code> is <code>Sync</code> if <code>&amp;T</code> (a reference to <code>T</code>) is <code>Send</code>, meaning the
reference can be sent safely to another thread. In a similar manner as <code>Send</code>,
primitive types are <code>Sync</code> and types composed entirely of types that are <code>Sync</code>
are also <code>Sync</code>.</p>
<p><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is also not <code>Sync</code>, for the same reasons that it’s not <code>Send</code>.
<code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> (which we talked about in Chapter 15) and the family of related
<code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code> types are not <code>Sync</code>. The implementation of borrow checking that
<code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> does at runtime is not threadsafe. <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> is <code>Sync</code>, and can
be used to share access with multiple threads as we saw in the previous section.</p>

<p>Because types that are made up of <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> traits are automatically
also <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>, we don’t have to implement those traits ourselves. As
marker traits, they don’t even have any methods to implement. They’re just
useful for enforcing concurrency-related invariants.</p>
<p>Manually implementing these traits involves implementing unsafe Rust code.
We’re going to be talking about using unsafe Rust code in Chapter 19; for now,
the important information is that building new concurrent types not made up of
<code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> parts requires careful thought, in order to uphold the safety
guarantees. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nomicon/">The Nomicon</a> has more information about these guarantees and how
to uphold them.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#summary-14" id="summary-14"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>This isn’t the last we’ll see of concurrency in this book; the project in
Chapter 20 will use these concepts in a more realistic situation than the
smaller examples discussed here.</p>
<p>As we mentioned, since very little of how Rust deals with concurrency is part
of the language, many concurrency solutions are implemented as crates. These
evolve more quickly than the standard library; search online for the current
state-of-the-art crates to use in multithreaded situations.</p>
<p>Rust provides channels for message passing and smart pointer types like
<code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code> that are safe to use in concurrent contexts. The type
system and the borrow checker will make sure the code using these solutions
won’t end up with data races or invalid references. Once we get our code
compiling, we can rest assured that it will happily run on multiple threads
without the kinds of hard-to-track-down bugs common in other languages.
Concurrent programming is no longer something to be afraid of: go forth and
make your programs concurrent, fearlessly!</p>
<p>Next, let’s talk about idiomatic ways to model problems and structure solutions
as your Rust programs get bigger, and how Rust’s idioms relate to those you
might be familiar with from Object Oriented Programming.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#is-rust-an-object-oriented-programming-language" id="is-rust-an-object-oriented-programming-language"><h1>Is Rust an Object-Oriented Programming Language?</h1></a>
<p>Object-Oriented Programming is a way of modeling programs that originated with
Simula in the 1960s and became popular with C++ in the 1990s. There are many
competing definitions for what counts as OOP, and under some definitions, Rust
is object-oriented; under other definitions, it is not. In this chapter, we’ll
explore some characteristics that are commonly considered to be object-oriented
and how those characteristics translate to idiomatic Rust. We’ll then show you
how to implement an object-oriented design pattern in Rust and discuss the
tradeoffs of doing so versus implementing a solution using some of Rust’s
strengths instead.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#what-does-object-oriented-mean" id="what-does-object-oriented-mean"><h2>What Does Object-Oriented Mean?</h2></a>
<p>There’s no consensus in the programming community about what features a
language needs in order to be called object-oriented. Rust is influenced by
many different programming paradigms including OOP; we explored, for example,
the features that came from functional programming in Chapter 13. Arguably,
object-oriented programming languages do tend to share certain common
characteristics, namely objects, encapsulation, and inheritance. Let’s take a
look at what each of those mean and whether Rust supports them.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#objects-contain-data-and-behavior" id="objects-contain-data-and-behavior"><h3>Objects Contain Data and Behavior</h3></a>
<!-- Is there a reason we're using this book as the reference, is it generally
accepted as an authority? -->
<!-- Yes, it is. For example, Martin Fowler (himself regarded as an authority)
had this to say about it https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/GangOfFour.html:
> In my view the Gang of Four is the best book ever written on object-oriented
> design - possibly of any style of design.
/Carol -->
<p>The book “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,”
colloquially referred to as “The Gang of Four book,” is a catalog of
object-oriented design patterns. It defines object-oriented programming in this
way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Object-oriented programs are made up of objects. An <em>object</em> packages both
data and the procedures that operate on that data. The procedures are
typically called <em>methods</em> or <em>operations</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under this definition, then, Rust is object-oriented: structs and enums have
data and <code>impl</code> blocks provide methods on structs and enums. Even though
structs and enums with methods aren’t <em>called</em> objects, they provide the same
functionality, under the Gang of Four’s definition of objects.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#encapsulation-that-hides-implementation-details" id="encapsulation-that-hides-implementation-details"><h3>Encapsulation that Hides Implementation Details</h3></a>
<p>Another aspect commonly associated with object-oriented programming is the idea
of <em>encapsulation</em>: that the implementation details of an object aren’t
accessible to code using that object. The only way to interact with an object
therefore is through its public API; code using the object should not be able
to reach into the object’s internals and change data or behavior directly. This
enables the programmer to change and refactor an object’s internals without
needing to change the code that uses the object.</p>
<p>We discussed an example of this in Chapter 7: We can use the <code>pub</code> keyword to
decide what modules, types, functions, and methods in our code should be
public, and by default everything else is private. For example, we can define a
struct <code>AveragedCollection</code> that has a field containing a vector of <code>i32</code>
values. The struct can also have a field that contains the average of the
values in the vector, meaning the average doesn’t have to be computed on-demand
whenever anyone needs it. In other words, <code>AveragedCollection</code> will cache the
calculated average for us. Listing 17-1 has the definition of the
<code>AveragedCollection</code> struct:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub struct AveragedCollection {
    list: Vec&lt;i32&gt;,
    average: f64,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-1: An <code>AveragedCollection</code> struct that
maintains a list of integers and the average of the items in the
collection.</span></p>
<p>The struct itself is marked <code>pub</code> so that other code may use it, but the fields
within the struct remain private. This is important in this case because we
want to ensure that whenever a value is added or removed from the list, the
average is also updated. We do this by implementing <code>add</code>, <code>remove</code>, and
<code>average</code> methods on the struct as shown in Listing 17-2:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# pub struct AveragedCollection {
#     list: Vec&lt;i32&gt;,
#     average: f64,
# }
impl AveragedCollection {
    pub fn add(&amp;mut self, value: i32) {
        self.list.push(value);
        self.update_average();
    }

    pub fn remove(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {
        let result = self.list.pop();
        match result {
            Some(value) =&gt; {
                self.update_average();
                Some(value)
            },
            None =&gt; None,
        }
    }

    pub fn average(&amp;self) -&gt; f64 {
        self.average
    }

    fn update_average(&amp;mut self) {
        let total: i32 = self.list.iter().sum();
        self.average = total as f64 / self.list.len() as f64;
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-2: Implementations of the public methods
<code>add</code>, <code>remove</code>, and <code>average</code> on <code>AveragedCollection</code></span></p>
<p>The public methods <code>add</code>, <code>remove</code>, and <code>average</code> are the only way to modify an
instance of <code>AveragedCollection</code>. When an item is added to <code>list</code> using the
<code>add</code> method or removed using the <code>remove</code> method, the implementations of each
call the private <code>update_average</code> method that takes care of updating the
<code>average</code> field as well.</p>
<p>We leave the <code>list</code> and <code>average</code> fields private so that there’s no way for
external code to add or remove items to the <code>list</code> field directly, otherwise
the <code>average</code> field might become out of sync when the <code>list</code> changes. The
<code>average</code> method returns the value in the <code>average</code> field, allowing external
code to read the <code>average</code> but not modify it.</p>
<p>Because we’ve encapsulated the implementation details of <code>AveragedCollection</code>,
we can easily change aspects like the data structure in the future. For
instance, we could use a <code>HashSet</code> instead of a <code>Vec</code> for the <code>list</code> field. As
long as the signatures of the <code>add</code>, <code>remove</code>, and <code>average</code> public methods
stay the same, code using <code>AveragedCollection</code> wouldn’t need to change. If we
made <code>list</code> public instead, this wouldn’t necessarily be the case: <code>HashSet</code>
and <code>Vec</code> have different methods for adding and removing items, so the external
code would likely have to change if it was modifying <code>list</code> directly.</p>
<p>If encapsulation is a required aspect for a language to be considered
object-oriented, then Rust meets that requirement. The option to use <code>pub</code> or
not for different parts of code enables encapsulation of implementation details.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#inheritance-as-a-type-system-and-as-code-sharing" id="inheritance-as-a-type-system-and-as-code-sharing"><h3>Inheritance as a Type System and as Code Sharing</h3></a>
<p><em>Inheritance</em> is a mechanism whereby an object can inherit from another
object’s definition, thus gaining the parent object’s data and behavior without
you having to define them again.</p>
<p>If a language must have inheritance to be an object-oriented language, then
Rust is not. There is no way to define a struct that inherits the parent
struct’s fields and method implementations. However, if you’re used to having
inheritance in your programming toolbox, there are other solutions in Rust
depending on your reason for reaching for inheritance in the first place.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons to choose inheritance. The first is for re-use of
code: you can implement particular behavior for one type, and inheritance
enables you to re-use that implementation for a different type. Rust code can
be shared using default trait method implementations instead, which we saw in
Listing 10-15 when we added a default implementation of the <code>summary</code> method on
the <code>Summarizable</code> trait. Any type implementing the <code>Summarizable</code> trait would
have the <code>summary</code> method available on it without any further code. This is
similar to a parent class having an implementation of a method, and an
inheriting child class then also having the implementation of the method. We
can also choose to override the default implementation of the <code>summary</code> method
when we implement the <code>Summarizable</code> trait, similar to a child class overriding
the implementation of a method inherited from a parent class.</p>
<p>The second reason to use inheritance relates to the type system: to enable a
child type to be used in the same places as the parent type. This is also
called <em>polymorphism</em>, which means that multiple objects can be substituted for
each other at runtime if they share certain characteristics.</p>
<!-- What does it mean for objects to have the same shape? -->
<!-- The use of "shape" in this context has to do with the roots of "morph" in
"polymorphism", but it's not very well defined so I've reworded. /Carol -->
<!-- PROD: START BOX -->
<blockquote>
<p>Polymorphism</p>
<p>To many people, polymorphism is synonymous with inheritance. But it’s
actually a more general concept that refers to code that can work with data
of multiple types. For inheritance, those types are generally subclasses.
Rust instead uses generics to abstract over different possible types, and
trait bounds to impose constraints on what those types must provide. This is
sometimes called <em>bounded parametric polymorphism</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- PROD: END BOX -->
<p>Inheritance has recently fallen out of favor as a programming design solution
in many programming languages because it’s often at risk of sharing more code
than needs be. Subclasses shouldn’t always share all characteristics of their
parent class, but will do so with inheritance. This can make a program’s design
less flexible, and introduces the possibility of calling methods on subclasses
that don’t make sense or that cause errors because the methods don’t actually
apply to the subclass. Some languages will also only allow a subclass to
inherit from one class, further restricting the flexibility of a program’s
design.</p>
<p>For these reasons, Rust chose to take a different approach, using trait objects
instead of inheritance. Let’s take a look at how trait objects enable
polymorphism in Rust.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-trait-objects-that-allow-for-values-of-different-types" id="using-trait-objects-that-allow-for-values-of-different-types"><h2>Using Trait Objects that Allow for Values of Different Types</h2></a>
<p>In Chapter 8, we mentioned that one limitation of vectors is that they can only
store elements of one type. We created a workaround in Listing 8-10 where we
defined a <code>SpreadsheetCell</code> enum that had variants to hold integers, floats,
and text. This meant we could store different types of data in each cell and
still have a vector that represented a row of cells. This is a perfectly good
solution when our interchangeable items are a fixed set of types that we know
when our code gets compiled.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, we want the user of our library to be able to extend the
set of types that are valid in a particular situation. To show how we might
achieve this, we’ll create an example Graphical User Interface tool that
iterates through a list of items, calling a <code>draw</code> method on each one to drawn
it to the screen; a common technique for GUI tools. We’re going to create a
library crate containing the structure of a GUI library called <code>rust_gui</code>. This
crate might include some types for people to use, such as <code>Button</code> or
<code>TextField</code>. On top of these, users of <code>rust_gui</code> will want to create their own
types that can be drawn on the screen: for instance, one programmer might add
an <code>Image</code>, another might add a <code>SelectBox</code>.</p>
<p>We won’t implement a fully-fledged GUI library for this example, but will show
how the pieces would fit together. At the time of writing the library, we can’t
know and define all the types other programmers will want to create. What we do
know is that <code>rust_gui</code> needs to keep track of a bunch of values that are of
different types, and it needs to be able to call a <code>draw</code> method on each of
these differently-typed values. It doesn’t need to know exactly what will
happen when we call the <code>draw</code> method, just that the value will have that
method available for us to call.</p>
<p>To do this in a language with inheritance, we might define a class named
<code>Component</code> that has a method named <code>draw</code> on it. The other classes like
<code>Button</code>, <code>Image</code>, and <code>SelectBox</code> would inherit from <code>Component</code> and thus
inherit the <code>draw</code> method. They could each override the <code>draw</code> method to define
their custom behavior, but the framework could treat all of the types as if
they were <code>Component</code> instances and call <code>draw</code> on them. But Rust doesn’t have
inheritance, so we need another way.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#defining-a-trait-for-common-behavior" id="defining-a-trait-for-common-behavior"><h3>Defining a Trait for Common Behavior</h3></a>
<p>To implement the behavior we want <code>rust_gui</code> to have, we’ll define a trait
named <code>Draw</code> that will have one method named <code>draw</code>. Then we can define a
vector that takes a <em>trait object</em>. A trait object points to an instance of a
type that implements the trait we specify. We create a trait object by
specifying some sort of pointer, such as a <code>&amp;</code> reference or a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> smart
pointer, and then specifying the relevant trait (we’ll talk about the reason
trait objects have to use a pointer in Chapter 19 in the section on Dynamically
Sized Types). We can use trait objects in place of a generic or concrete type.
Wherever we use a trait object, Rust’s type system will ensure at compile-time
that any value used in that context will implement the trait object’s trait.
This way we don’t need to know all the possible types at compile time.</p>
<!-- What will the trait object do in this case? I've taken this last part of
the line from below, but I'm not 100% on that -->
<!-- I've moved up more and reworded a bit, hope that clarifies /Carol -->
<p>We’ve mentioned that in Rust we refrain from calling structs and enums
“objects” to distinguish them from other languages’ objects. In a struct or
enum, the data in the struct fields and the behavior in <code>impl</code> blocks is
separated, whereas in other languages the data and behavior combined into one
concept is often labeled an object. Trait objects, though, <em>are</em> more like
objects in other languages, in the sense that they combine both data and
behavior. However, trait objects differ from traditional objects in that we
can’t add data to a trait object. Trait objects aren’t as generally useful as
objects in other languages: their specific purpose is to allow abstraction
across common behavior.</p>
<p>Listing 17-3 shows how to define a trait named <code>Draw</code> with one method named
<code>draw</code>:</p>

<p>This should look familiar from our discussions on how to define traits in
Chapter 10. Next comes something new: Listing 17-4 defines a struct named
<code>Screen</code> that holds a vector named <code>components</code>. This vector is of type
<code>Box&lt;Draw&gt;</code>, which is a trait object: it’s a stand-in for any type inside a
<code>Box</code> that implements the <code>Draw</code> trait.</p>

that be clear at this point? -->

<p>On the <code>Screen</code> struct, we’ll define a method named <code>run</code> that will call the

<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-5: Implementing a <code>run</code> method on <code>Screen</code>

<p>This works differently to defining a struct that uses a generic type parameter
with trait bounds. A generic type parameter can only be substituted with one
concrete type at a time, while trait objects allow for multiple concrete types
to fill in for the trait object at runtime. For example, we could have defined
the <code>Screen</code> struct using a generic type and a trait bound as in Listing 17-6:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">

impl&lt;T&gt; Screen&lt;T&gt;
    where T: Draw {
    pub fn run(&amp;self) {
        for component in self.components.iter() {
            component.draw();

}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-6: An alternate implementation of the <code>Screen</code>

<p>This restricts us to a <code>Screen</code> instance that has a list of components all of
type <code>Button</code> or all of type <code>TextField</code>. If you’ll only ever have homogeneous
collections, using generics and trait bounds is preferable since the
definitions will be monomorphized at compile time to use the concrete types.</p>
<p>With the the method using trait objects, on the other hand, one <code>Screen</code>
instance can hold a <code>Vec</code> that contains a <code>Box&lt;Button&gt;</code> as well as a

performance implications.</p>

<p>Now we’ll add some types that implement the <code>Draw</code> trait. We’re going to
provide the <code>Button</code> type. Again, actually implementing a GUI library is out of
scope of this book, so the <code>draw</code> method won’t have any useful implementation
in its body. To imagine what the implementation might look like, a <code>Button</code>
struct might have fields for <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>label</code>, as shown in
Listing 17-7:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# pub trait Draw {
#     fn draw(&amp;self);
# }
#
pub struct Button {
    pub width: u32,
    pub height: u32,
    pub label: String,
}

impl Draw for Button {
    fn draw(&amp;self) {
        // Code to actually draw a button
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-7: A <code>Button</code> struct that implements the
<code>Draw</code> trait</span></p>
<p>The <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>label</code> fields on <code>Button</code> will differ from the
fields on other components, such as a <code>TextField</code> type that might have those
plus a <code>placeholder</code> field instead. Each of the types we want to draw on the
screen will implement the <code>Draw</code> trait, with different code in the <code>draw</code>
method to define how to draw that particular type, like <code>Button</code> has here
(without the actual GUI code that’s out of scope of this chapter). <code>Button</code>,
for instance, might have an additional <code>impl</code> block containing methods related
to what happens if the button is clicked. These kinds of methods won’t apply to
types like <code>TextField</code>.</p>
<p>Someone using our library has decided to implement a <code>SelectBox</code> struct that
has <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>options</code> fields. They implement the <code>Draw</code> trait on
the <code>SelectBox</code> type as well, as shown in Listing 17-8:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate rust_gui;

struct SelectBox {

}

impl Draw for SelectBox {
    fn draw(&amp;self) {
        // Code to actually draw a select box
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-8: Another crate using <code>rust_gui</code> and

<p>The user of our library can now write their <code>main</code> function to create a

each in a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> to become a trait object. They can then call the <code>run</code>
method on the <code>Screen</code> instance, which will call <code>draw</code> on each of the
components. Listing 17-9 shows this implementation:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-9: Using trait objects to store values of
different types that implement the same trait</span></p>
<p>When we wrote the library, we didn’t know that someone would add the
<code>SelectBox</code> type someday, but our <code>Screen</code> implementation was able to operate
on the new type and draw it because <code>SelectBox</code> implements the <code>Draw</code> type,
which means it implements the <code>draw</code> method.</p>
<p>This concept---of being concerned only with the messages a value responds to,
rather than the value’s concrete type---is similar to a concept in dynamically
typed languages called <em>duck typing</em>: if it walks like a duck, and quacks like
a duck, then it must be a duck! In the implementation of <code>run</code> on <code>Screen</code> in
Listing 17-5, <code>run</code> doesn’t need to know what the concrete type of each
component is. It doesn’t check to see if a component is an instance of a
<code>Button</code> or a <code>SelectBox</code>, it just calls the <code>draw</code> method on the component. By
specifying <code>Box&lt;Draw&gt;</code> as the type of the values in the <code>components</code> vector,
we’ve defined <code>Screen</code> to need values that we can call the <code>draw</code> method on.</p>
<!-- I may be slow on the uptake here, but it seems like we're saying that
responsibility for how the type trait object behaves with the draw method is
called on it belongs to the trait object, and not to the draw method itself. Is
that an accurate summary? I want to make sure I'm clearly following the
argument! -->
<!-- Each type (like `Button` or `SelectBox`) that implements the `Draw` trait
can customize what happens in the body of the `draw` method. The trait object
is just responsible for making sure that the only things that are usable in
that context are things that implement the `Draw` trait. Does this clear it up
at all? Is there something we should clarify in the text? /Carol -->
<p>The advantage of using trait objects and Rust’s type system to do something
similar to duck typing is that we never have to check that a value implements a
particular method at runtime or worry about getting errors if a value doesn’t
implement a method but we call it anyway. Rust won’t compile our code if the
values don’t implement the traits that the trait objects need.</p>
<p>For example, Listing 17-10 shows what happens if we try to create a <code>Screen</code>
with a <code>String</code> as a component:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate rust_gui;

            Box::new(String::from(&quot;Hi&quot;)),
        ],
    };

    screen.run();
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-10: Attempting to use a type that doesn’t

<p>This lets us know that either we’re passing something to <code>Screen</code> we didn’t

<a class="header" href="print.html#trait-objects-perform-dynamic-dispatch" id="trait-objects-perform-dynamic-dispatch"><h3>Trait Objects Perform Dynamic Dispatch</h3></a>
<p>Recall from Chapter 10 our discussion on the monomorphization process performed
by the compiler when we use trait bounds on generics: the compiler generates
non-generic implementations of functions and methods for each concrete type
that we use in place of a generic type parameter. The code that results from
monomorphization is doing <em>static dispatch</em>. Static dispatch is when the
compiler knows what method you’re calling at compile time. This is opposed to
<em>dynamic dispatch</em>, when the compiler can’t tell at compile time which method
you’re calling. In these cases, the compiler emits code that will figure out at
runtime which method to call.</p>
<!--I'm struggling to follow the static dispatch definition, can you expand
that a little? Which part of that is the static dispatch, pre-determining the
code called with a method and storing it? -->
<!-- Yes, in a way. We've expanded and moved the definitions of static and
dynamic dispatch together to better contrast, hopefully this helps? /Carol -->
<p>When we use trait objects, Rust has to use dynamic dispatch. The compiler
doesn’t know all the types that might be used with the code using trait
objects, so it doesn’t know which method implemented on which type to call.
Instead, Rust uses the pointers inside of the trait object at runtime to know
which specific method to call. There’s a runtime cost when this lookup happens,
compared to static dispatch. Dynamic dispatch also prevents the compiler from
choosing to inline a method’s code which in turn prevents some optimizations.
We did get extra flexibility in the code that we wrote and were able to
support, though, so it’s a tradeoff to consider.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#object-safety-is-required-for-trait-objects" id="object-safety-is-required-for-trait-objects"><h3>Object Safety is Required for Trait Objects</h3></a>
<!-- Liz: we're conflicted on including this section. Not being able to use a
trait as a trait object because of object safety is something that
beginner/intermediate Rust developers run into sometimes, but explaining it
fully is long and complicated. Should we just cut this whole section? Leave it
(and finish the explanation of how to fix the error at the end)? Shorten it to
a quick caveat, that just says something like "Some traits can't be trait
objects. Clone is an example of one. You'll get errors that will let you know
if a trait can't be a trait object, look up object safety if you're interested
in the details"? Thanks! /Carol -->
<!-- That sounds like a good solution, since the compiler will warn them in any
case. I read through, editing a little, and I agree we could afford to cut it,
I'm not sure it brings practical skills to the user -->
<!-- Ok, I've cut section way down to the practical pieces, but still explained
a little bit /Carol -->
<p>Only <em>object safe</em> traits can be made into trait objects. There are some
complex rules around all the properties that make a trait object safe, but in
practice, there are only two rules that are relevant. A trait is object safe if
all of the methods defined in the trait have the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The return type isn’t <code>Self</code></li>
<li>There aren’t any generic type parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Self</code> keyword is an alias for the type we’re implementing traits or
methods on. Object safety is required for trait objects because once you have a
trait object, you no longer know what the concrete type implementing that trait
is. If a trait method returns the concrete <code>Self</code> type, but a trait object
forgets the exact type that it is, there’s no way that the method can use the
original concrete type that it’s forgotten. Same with generic type parameters
that are filled in with concrete type parameters when the trait is used: the
concrete types become part of the type that implements the trait. When the type
is erased by the use of a trait object, there’s no way to know what types to
fill in the generic type parameters with.</p>
<p>An example of a trait whose methods are not object safe is the standard
library’s <code>Clone</code> trait. The signature for the <code>clone</code> method in the <code>Clone</code>
trait looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub trait Clone {
    fn clone(&amp;self) -&gt; Self;
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><code>String</code> implements the <code>Clone</code> trait, and when we call the <code>clone</code> method on
an instance of <code>String</code> we get back an instance of <code>String</code>. Similarly, if we
call <code>clone</code> on an instance of <code>Vec</code>, we get back an instance of <code>Vec</code>. The
signature of <code>clone</code> needs to know what type will stand in for <code>Self</code>, since
that’s the return type.</p>
<p>The compiler will tell you if you’re trying to do something that violates the
rules of object safety in regards to trait objects. For example, if we had
tried to implement the <code>Screen</code> struct in Listing 17-4 to hold types that
implement the <code>Clone</code> trait instead of the <code>Draw</code> trait, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub struct Screen {
    pub components: Vec&lt;Box&lt;Clone&gt;&gt;,
}
</code></pre>
<p>We’ll get this error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0038]: the trait `std::clone::Clone` cannot be made into an object
 --&gt;
  |
2 |     pub components: Vec&lt;Box&lt;Clone&gt;&gt;,
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `std::clone::Clone` cannot be
  made into an object
  |
  = note: the trait cannot require that `Self : Sized`
</code></pre>
<p>This means you can’t use this trait as a trait object in this way. If you’re
interested in more details on object safety, see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0255-object-safety.md">Rust RFC 255</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#implementing-an-object-oriented-design-pattern" id="implementing-an-object-oriented-design-pattern"><h2>Implementing an Object-Oriented Design Pattern</h2></a>
<p>The <em>state pattern</em> is an object-oriented design pattern. The crux of the
pattern is that a value has some internal state, represented by a set of <em>state
objects</em>, and the value’s behavior changes based on the internal state. The
state objects share functionality--in Rust, of course, we use structs and
traits rather than objects and inheritance. Each state object representing the
state is responsible for its own behavior and for governing when it should
change into another state. The value that holds a state object knows nothing
about the different behavior of the states or when to transition between states.</p>
<!-- Below -- requirements for what, for what we need the value for? -->
<!-- I've clarified /Carol -->
<p>Using the state pattern means when the business requirements of the program
change, we won’t need to change the code of the value holding the state or the
code that uses the value. We’ll only need to update the code inside one of the
state objects to change its rules, or perhaps add more state objects. Let’s
look at an example of the state design pattern and how to use it in Rust.</p>
<p>To explore this idea, we’ll implement a blog post workflow in an incremental
way. The blog’s final functionality will look like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A blog post starts as an empty draft.</li>
<li>Once the draft is done, a review of the post is requested.</li>
<li>Once the post is approved, it gets published.</li>
<li>Only published blog posts return content to print, so unapproved posts can’t
accidentally be published.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any other changes attempted on a post should have no effect. For example, if we
try to approve a draft blog post before we’ve requested a review, the post
should stay an unpublished draft.</p>
<p>Listing 17-11 shows this workflow in code form. This is an example usage of the
API we’re going to implement in a library crate named <code>blog</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate blog;
use blog::Post;

fn main() {
    let mut post = Post::new();

    post.add_text(&quot;I ate a salad for lunch today&quot;);
    assert_eq!(&quot;&quot;, post.content());

    post.request_review();
    assert_eq!(&quot;&quot;, post.content());

    post.approve();
    assert_eq!(&quot;I ate a salad for lunch today&quot;, post.content());
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-11: Code that demonstrates the desired
behavior we want our <code>blog</code> crate to have</span></p>
<p>We want to allow the user to create a new draft blog post with <code>Post::new</code>.
Then, we want to allow text to be added to the blog post while it’s in the
draft state. If we try to get the post’s content immediately, before
approval, nothing should happen because the post is still a draft. We’ve added
an <code>assert_eq!</code> here for demonstration purposes. An excellent unit test for
this would be to assert that a draft blog post returns an empty string from the
<code>content</code> method, but we’re not going to write tests for this example.</p>
<p>Next, we want to enable a request for a review of the post, and we want
<code>content</code> to return an empty string while waiting for the review. Lastly, when
the post receives approval, it should get published, meaning the text of the
post will be returned when <code>content</code> is called.</p>
<!-- Below -- so this is where we'll implement the state pattern? If so, can
you make that explicit, just to be clear! I've added some text to the second
line, not sure if that's accurate though -->
<!-- Yes, the state pattern will be implemented within the `Post` type. I've
tweaked the wording a bit but you've pretty much got it! /Carol-->
<p>Notice that the only type we’re interacting with from the crate is the <code>Post</code>
type. This type will use the state pattern and will hold a value that will be
one of three state objects representing the various states a post can be
in---draft, waiting for review, or published. Changing from one state to
another will be managed internally within the <code>Post</code> type. The states change in
response to the methods users of our library call on the <code>Post</code> instance, but
they don’t have to manage the state changes directly. This also means users
can’t make a mistake with the states, like publishing a post before it is
reviewed.</p>

<p>Let’s get started on the implementation of the library! We know we need a
public <code>Post</code> struct that holds some content, so let’s start with the
definition of the struct and an associated public <code>new</code> function to create an
instance of <code>Post</code>, as shown in Listing 17-12. We’ll also make a private
<code>State</code> trait. Then <code>Post</code> will hold a trait object of <code>Box&lt;State&gt;</code> inside an
<code>Option</code> in a private field named <code>state</code>. We’ll see why the <code>Option</code> is
necessary in a bit.</p>
<p>The <code>State</code> trait defines the behavior shared by different post states, and the
<code>Draft</code>, <code>PendingReview</code>, and <code>Published</code> states will all implement the <code>State</code>
trait. For now, the trait does not have any methods, and we’re going to start
by defining just the <code>Draft</code> state since that’s the state we want a post to
start in:</p>

<p>When we create a new <code>Post</code>, we set its <code>state</code> field to a <code>Some</code> value that
holds a <code>Box</code>. This <code>Box</code> points to a new instance of the <code>Draft</code> struct. This
ensures whenever we create a new instance of <code>Post</code>, it’ll start out as a

a <code>Post</code> in any other state!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#storing-the-text-of-the-post-content" id="storing-the-text-of-the-post-content"><h3>Storing the Text of the Post Content</h3></a>
<p>In the <code>Post::new</code> function, we set the <code>content</code> field to a new, empty
<code>String</code>. Listing 17-11 showed that we want to be able to call a method named
<code>add_text</code> and pass it a <code>&amp;str</code> that’s then added to the text content of the
blog post. We implement this as a method rather than exposing the <code>content</code>
field as <code>pub</code>. This means we can implement a method later that will control
how the <code>content</code> field’s data is read. The <code>add_text</code> method is pretty
straightforward, so let’s add the implementation in Listing 17-13 to the <code>impl Post</code> block:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# pub struct Post {

impl Post {
    // --snip--
    pub fn add_text(&amp;mut self, text: &amp;str) {
        self.content.push_str(text);
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-13: Implementing the <code>add_text</code> method to add
text to a post’s <code>content</code></span></p>
<p><code>add_text</code> takes a mutable reference to <code>self</code>, since we’re changing the <code>Post</code>
instance that we’re calling <code>add_text</code> on. We then call <code>push_str</code> on the
<code>String</code> in <code>content</code> and pass the <code>text</code> argument to add to the saved
<code>content</code>. This behavior doesn’t depend on the state the post is in so it’s not
part of the state pattern. The <code>add_text</code> method doesn’t interact with the
<code>state</code> field at all, but it is part of the behavior we want to support.</p>

<p>Even after we’ve called <code>add_text</code> and added some content to our post, we still
want the <code>content</code> method to return an empty string slice since the post is
still in the draft state, as shown on line 8 of Listing 17-11. For now, let’s
implement the <code>content</code> method with the simplest thing that will fulfill this
requirement: always returning an empty string slice. We’re going to change this
later once we implement the ability to change a post’s state so it can be
published. So far, though, posts can only be in the draft state, so the post
content should always be empty. Listing 17-14 shows this placeholder
implementation:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-15: Implementing <code>request_review</code> methods on
<code>Post</code> and the <code>State</code> trait</span></p>
<p>We’ve added the <code>request_review</code> method to the <code>State</code> trait; all types that
implement the trait will now need to implement the <code>request_review</code> method.
Note that rather than having <code>self</code>, <code>&amp;self</code>, or <code>&amp;mut self</code> as the first
parameter of the method, we have <code>self: Box&lt;Self&gt;</code>. This syntax means the
method is only valid when called on a <code>Box</code> holding the type. This syntax takes
ownership of <code>Box&lt;Self&gt;</code>, invalidating the old state so that the state value of
the <code>Post</code> can transform itself into a new state.</p>
<!-- Above -- so Post can transform, or so Draft can transform? -->
<!-- Technically it's so the Draft value can transform into another value,
which changes the state of Post-- I've tried to clarify. /Carol -->
<p>To consume the old state, the <code>request_review</code> method needs to take ownership
of the state value. This is where the <code>Option</code> in the <code>state</code> field of <code>Post</code>
comes in: we call the <code>take</code> method to take the <code>Some</code> value out of the <code>state</code>
field and leave a <code>None</code> in its place, since Rust doesn’t let us have
unpopulated fields in structs. This lets us move the <code>state</code> value out of
<code>Post</code> rather than borrowing it. Then we’ll set the post’s <code>state</code> value to the
result of this operation.</p>
<p>We need to set <code>state</code> to <code>None</code> temporarily, rather than code like <code>self.state = self.state.request_review();</code> that would set the <code>state</code> field directly, to
get ownership of the <code>state</code> value. This ensures <code>Post</code> can’t use the old
<code>state</code> value after we’ve transformed it into a new state.</p>
<p>The <code>request_review</code> method on <code>Draft</code> needs to return a new, boxed instance of
a new <code>PendingReview</code> struct, which represents the state when a post is waiting
for a review. The <code>PendingReview</code> struct also implements the <code>request_review</code>
method, but doesn’t do any transformations. Rather, it returns itself, since
when we request a review on a post already in the <code>PendingReview</code> state, it
should stay in the <code>PendingReview</code> state.</p>
<p>Now we can start seeing the advantages of the state pattern: the
<code>request_review</code> method on <code>Post</code> is the same no matter its <code>state</code> value. Each
state is responsible for its own rules.</p>
<p>We’re going to leave the <code>content</code> method on <code>Post</code> as it is, returning an
empty string slice. We can now have a <code>Post</code> in the <code>PendingReview</code> state as
well as the <code>Draft</code> state, but we want the same behavior in the <code>PendingReview</code>
state. Listing 17-11 now works up until line 11!</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-16: Implementing the <code>approve</code> method on
<code>Post</code> and the <code>State</code> trait</span></p>
<p>We add the <code>approve</code> method to the <code>State</code> trait, and add a new struct that
implements <code>State</code>, the <code>Published</code> state.</p>
<p>Similar to <code>request_review</code>, if we call the <code>approve</code> method on a <code>Draft</code>, it
will have no effect since it will return <code>self</code>. When we call <code>approve</code> on
<code>PendingReview</code>, it returns a new, boxed instance of the <code>Published</code> struct.
The <code>Published</code> struct implements the <code>State</code> trait, and for both the
<code>request_review</code> method and the <code>approve</code> method, it returns itself, since the
post should stay in the <code>Published</code> state in those cases.</p>
<p>Now to update the <code>content</code> method on <code>Post</code>: if the state is <code>Published</code> we
want to return the value in the post’s <code>content</code> field; otherwise we want to
return an empty string slice, as shown in Listing 17-17:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# trait State {
#     fn content&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;self, post: &amp;'a Post) -&gt; &amp;'a str;
# }
# pub struct Post {
#     state: Option&lt;Box&lt;State&gt;&gt;,
#     content: String,
# }
#
impl Post {
    // --snip--
    pub fn content(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;str {
        self.state.as_ref().unwrap().content(&amp;self)
    }
    // --snip--
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-17: Updating the <code>content</code> method on <code>Post</code> to
delegate to a <code>content</code> method on <code>State</code></span></p>
<p>Because the goal is to keep all these rules inside the structs that implement
<code>State</code>, we call a <code>content</code> method on the value in <code>state</code> and pass the post
instance (that is, <code>self</code>) as an argument. Then we return the value that’s
returned from using the <code>content</code> method on the <code>state</code> value.</p>
<p>We call the <code>as_ref</code> method on the <code>Option</code> because we want a reference to the
value inside the <code>Option</code> rather than ownership of it. Because <code>state</code> is an
<code>Option&lt;Box&lt;State&gt;&gt;</code>, calling <code>as_ref</code> returns an <code>Option&lt;&amp;Box&lt;State&gt;&gt;</code>. If we
didn’t call <code>as_ref</code>, we’d get an error because we can’t move <code>state</code> out of
the borrowed <code>&amp;self</code> of the function parameter.</p>
<p>We’re then calling the <code>unwrap</code> method, which we know will never panic, because
we know the methods on <code>Post</code> ensure that <code>state</code> will always contain a <code>Some</code>
value when those methods are done. This is one of the cases we talked about in
Chapter 12 when we know that a <code>None</code> value is never possible, even though the
compiler isn’t able to understand that.</p>
<p>So then we have a <code>&amp;Box&lt;State&gt;</code>, and when we call the <code>content</code> on it, deref
coercion will take effect on the <code>&amp;</code> and the <code>Box</code> so that the <code>content</code> method
will ultimately be called on the type that implements the <code>State</code> trait.</p>
<p>That means we need to add <code>content</code> to the <code>State</code> trait definition, and that’s
where we’ll put the logic for what content to return depending on which state
we have, as shown in Listing 17-18:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]

        &quot;&quot;
    }
}

// --snip--
struct Published {}

impl State for Published {
    // --snip--
    fn content&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;self, post: &amp;'a Post) -&gt; &amp;'a str {
        &amp;post.content
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-18: Adding the <code>content</code> method to the <code>State</code>
trait</span></p>
<p>We add a default implementation for the <code>content</code> method that returns an empty
string slice. That means we don’t need to implement <code>content</code> on the <code>Draft</code>
and <code>PendingReview</code> structs. The <code>Published</code> struct will override the <code>content</code>
method and return the value in <code>post.content</code>.</p>
<p>Note that we need lifetime annotations on this method, like we discussed in
Chapter 10. We’re taking a reference to a <code>post</code> as an argument, and returning
a reference to part of that <code>post</code>, so the lifetime of the returned reference
is related to the lifetime of the <code>post</code> argument.</p>
<!-- Is this it finished, without the touch up we make to get rid of the empty
string? That's pretty awesome coding, maybe give it some ceremony here. Does
all of 17-11 now work? -->
<!-- Yep! Good point, so added! /Carol -->
<p>And we’re done-- all of Listing 17-11 now works! We’ve implemented the state
pattern with the rules of the blog post workflow. The logic around the rules
lives in the state objects rather than scattered throughout <code>Post</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#tradeoffs-of-the-state-pattern" id="tradeoffs-of-the-state-pattern"><h3>Tradeoffs of the State Pattern</h3></a>
<p>We’ve shown that Rust is capable of implementing the object-oriented state
pattern to encapsulate the different kinds of behavior a post should have in
each state. The methods on <code>Post</code> know nothing about the different kinds of
behavior. The way this code is organized, we only have to look in one place to
know the different ways a published post can behave: the implementation of the
<code>State</code> trait on the <code>Published</code> struct.</p>
<p>If we were to create an alternative implementation that didn’t use the state
pattern we might use <code>match</code> statements in the methods on <code>Post</code>, or even in
the <code>main</code> code that checks the state of the post and changes behavior in those
places instead. That would mean we’d have to look in a lot of places to
understand all the implications of a post being in the published state! This
would only increase the more states we added: each of those <code>match</code> statements
would need another arm.</p>
<p>With the state pattern, the <code>Post</code> methods and the places we use <code>Post</code> don’t
need <code>match</code> statements, and to add a new state we would only need to add a new
<code>struct</code> and implement the trait methods on that one struct.</p>
<p>This implementation is easy to extend to add more functionality. To see the
simplicity of maintaining code that uses this patterns, try out a few of these
suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to add text content only when a post is in the <code>Draft</code> state</li>
<li>Add a <code>reject</code> method that changes the post’s state from <code>PendingReview</code> back
to <code>Draft</code></li>
<li>Require two calls to <code>approve</code> before the state can be changed to <code>Published</code></li>
</ul>
<p>One downside of the state pattern is that, because the states implement the
transitions between states, some of the states are coupled to each other. If we
add another state between <code>PendingReview</code> and <code>Published</code>, such as <code>Scheduled</code>,
we would have to change the code in <code>PendingReview</code> to transition to
<code>Scheduled</code> instead. It would be less work if <code>PendingReview</code> wouldn’t need to
change with the addition of a new state, but that would mean switching to
another design pattern.</p>
<p>Another downside is that we find ourselves with a few bits of duplicated logic.
To eliminate this, we might try to make default implementations for the
<code>request_review</code> and <code>approve</code> methods on the <code>State</code> trait that return <code>self</code>,
but this would violate object safety, since the trait doesn’t know what the
concrete <code>self</code> will be exactly. We want to be able to use <code>State</code> as a trait
object, so we need its methods to be object safe.</p>
<p>The other duplication is the similar implementations of the <code>request_review</code>
and <code>approve</code> methods on <code>Post</code>. Both methods delegate to the implementation of
the same method on the value in the <code>state</code> field of <code>Option</code>, and set the new
value of the <code>state</code> field to the result. If we had a lot of methods on <code>Post</code>
that followed this pattern, we might consider defining a macro to eliminate the
repetition (see Appendix D on macros).</p>
<p>By implementing this pattern exactly as it’s defined for object-oriented
languages, we’re not taking full advantage of Rust’s strengths as much as we
could. Let’s take a look at some changes we can make to this code that can make
invalid states and transitions into compile time errors.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types" id="encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types"><h4>Encoding States and Behavior as Types</h4></a>
<p>We’re going to show how to rethink the state pattern to get a different set of
tradeoffs. Rather than encapsulating the states and transitions completely so
that outside code has no knowledge of them, we’re going to encode the states
into different types. Like this, Rust’s type checking system will make attempts
to use draft posts where only published posts are allowed into a compiler error.</p>
<p>Let’s consider the first part of <code>main</code> from Listing 17-11:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let mut post = Post::new();

    post.add_text(&quot;I ate a salad for lunch today&quot;);
    assert_eq!(&quot;&quot;, post.content());
}
</code></pre>
<p>We still enable the creation of new posts in the draft state using <code>Post::new</code>,
and the ability to add text to the post’s content. But instead of having a
<code>content</code> method on a draft post that returns an empty string, we’ll make it so
that draft posts don’t have the <code>content</code> method at all. That way, if we try to
get a draft post’s content, we’ll get a compiler error telling us the method
doesn’t exist. This will make it impossible for us to accidentally display
draft post content in production, since that code won’t even compile. Listing
17-19 shows the definition of a <code>Post</code> struct, a <code>DraftPost</code> struct, and
methods on each:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub struct Post {
    content: String,
}

pub struct DraftPost {
    content: String,
}

impl Post {
    pub fn new() -&gt; DraftPost {
        DraftPost {
            content: String::new(),
        }
    }

    pub fn content(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;str {
       &amp;self.content
    }
}

impl DraftPost {
    pub fn add_text(&amp;mut self, text: &amp;str) {
        self.content.push_str(text);
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-19: A <code>Post</code> with a <code>content</code> method and a
<code>DraftPost</code> without a <code>content</code> method</span></p>
<p>Both the <code>Post</code> and <code>DraftPost</code> structs have a private <code>content</code> field that
stores the blog post text. The structs no longer have the <code>state</code> field since
we’re moving the encoding of the state to the types of the structs. <code>Post</code> will
represent a published post, and it has a <code>content</code> method that returns the
<code>content</code>.</p>
<p>We still have a <code>Post::new</code> function, but instead of returning an instance of
<code>Post</code>, it returns an instance of <code>DraftPost</code>. Because <code>content</code> is private,
and there aren’t any functions that return <code>Post</code>, it’s not possible to create
an instance of <code>Post</code> right now.</p>
<p><code>DraftPost</code> has an <code>add_text</code> method so we can add text to <code>content</code> as before,
but note that <code>DraftPost</code> does not have a <code>content</code> method defined! So now the
program ensures all posts start as draft posts, and draft posts don’t have
their content available for display. Any attempt to get around these
constraints will result in a compiler error.</p>

<p>So how do we get a published post then? We want to enforce the rule that a
draft post has to be reviewed and approved before it can be published. A post
in the pending review state should still not display any content. Let’s
implement these constraints by adding another struct, <code>PendingReviewPost</code>,
defining the <code>request_review</code> method on <code>DraftPost</code> to return a
<code>PendingReviewPost</code>, and defining an <code>approve</code> method on <code>PendingReviewPost</code> to
return a <code>Post</code> as shown in Listing 17-20:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {

impl DraftPost {
    // --snip--

    pub fn request_review(self) -&gt; PendingReviewPost {
        PendingReviewPost {
            content: self.content,
        }
    }
}

pub struct PendingReviewPost {
    content: String,
}

impl PendingReviewPost {
    pub fn approve(self) -&gt; Post {
        Post {
            content: self.content,
        }
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-20: A <code>PendingReviewPost</code> that gets created by
calling <code>request_review</code> on <code>DraftPost</code>, and an <code>approve</code> method that turns a
<code>PendingReviewPost</code> into a published <code>Post</code></span></p>
<p>The <code>request_review</code> and <code>approve</code> methods take ownership of <code>self</code>, thus
consuming the <code>DraftPost</code> and <code>PendingReviewPost</code> instances and transforming
them into a <code>PendingReviewPost</code> and a published <code>Post</code>, respectively. This way,
we won’t have any <code>DraftPost</code> instances lingering around after we’ve called
<code>request_review</code> on them, and so forth. <code>PendingReviewPost</code> doesn’t have a
<code>content</code> method defined on it, so attempting to read its content results in a
compiler error, as with <code>DraftPost</code>. Because the only way to get a published
<code>Post</code> instance that does have a <code>content</code> method defined is to call the
<code>approve</code> method on a <code>PendingReviewPost</code>, and the only way to get a
<code>PendingReviewPost</code> is to call the <code>request_review</code> method on a <code>DraftPost</code>,
we’ve now encoded the blog post workflow into the type system.</p>
<p>This does mean we have to make some small changes to <code>main</code>. The
<code>request_review</code> and <code>approve</code> methods return new instances rather than
modifying the struct they’re called on, so we need to add more <code>let post =</code>
shadowing assignments to save the returned instances. We also can’t have the
assertions about the draft and pending review post’s contents being empty
strings, nor do we need them: we can’t compile code that tries to use the
content of posts in those states any longer. The updated code in <code>main</code> is
shown in Listing 17-21:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate blog;
use blog::Post;

fn main() {
    let mut post = Post::new();

    post.add_text(&quot;I ate a salad for lunch today&quot;);

    let post = post.request_review();

    let post = post.approve();

    assert_eq!(&quot;I ate a salad for lunch today&quot;, post.content());
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 17-21: Modifications to <code>main</code> to use the new
implementation of the blog post workflow</span></p>
<p>These changes we need to make to <code>main</code> to reassign <code>post</code> means this
implementation doesn’t quite follow the object-oriented state pattern anymore:
the transformations between the states are no longer encapsulated entirely
within the <code>Post</code> implementation. However, our gain is that invalid states are
now impossible because of the type system and the type checking that happens at
compile time! This ensures that certain bugs, such as the content of an
unpublished post being displayed, will be discovered before they make it to
production.</p>
<p>Try the tasks suggested for additional requirements that we mentioned at the
start of this section on this code, to see how working with this version of the
code feels.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that even though Rust is capable of implementing object-oriented
design patterns, other patterns like encoding state into the type system are
also available in Rust. These patterns have different tradeoffs. While you may
be very familiar with object-oriented patterns, rethinking the problem in order
to take advantage of Rust’s features can provide benefits like preventing some
bugs at compile-time. Object-oriented patterns won’t always be the best
solution in Rust, because of the features like ownership that object-oriented
languages don’t have.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#summary-15" id="summary-15"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>No matter whether you think Rust is an object-oriented language or not after
reading this chapter, you’ve now seen that trait objects are a way to get some
object-oriented features in Rust. Dynamic dispatch can give your code some
flexibility in exchange for a bit of runtime performance. This flexibility can
be used to implement object-oriented patterns that can help with the
maintainability of your code. Rust also has other different features, like
ownership, that object-oriented languages don’t have. An object-oriented
pattern won’t always be the best way to take advantage of Rust’s strengths, but
is an available option.</p>
<p>Next, let’s look at another feature of Rust that enables lots of flexibility:
patterns. We’ve looked at them briefly throughout the book, but haven’t seen
everything they’re capable of yet. Let’s go!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#patterns-and-matching" id="patterns-and-matching"><h1>Patterns and Matching</h1></a>
<p>Patterns are a special syntax in Rust for matching against the structure of
types, both complex and simple. Using patterns in conjunction with <code>match</code>
expressions and other constructs gives you more control over the control flow
of a program. A pattern is made up of some combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>literals</li>
<li>destructured arrays, enums, structs, or tuples</li>
<li>variables</li>
<li>wildcards</li>
<li>placeholders</li>
</ul>
<p>These pieces describe the shape of the data we’re working with, which we then
match against values to determine whether our program has the correct data to
continue running a particular bit of code.</p>
<!-- I think we need a concise description of what we use patterns for here,
what they provide the programmer. Hopefully you can see what I've trying to do,
above! But I think you'll agree it's not quite right, can you have a whack, try
to give the reader that explanation? -->
<!-- We tweaked the wording a bit, how's this? /Carol -->
<p>To use a pattern we compare it to some value. If the pattern matches our value,
we use the value parts in our code. Recall our <code>match</code> expressions from Chapter
6 that used patterns like a coin sorting machine. If the value fits the shape
of the pattern, we can use the named pieces. If it doesn’t, the code associated
with the pattern won’t run.</p>
<p>This chapter is a reference on all things related to patterns. We’ll cover the
valid places to use patterns, the difference between <em>refutable</em> and
<em>irrefutable</em> patterns, and the different kinds of pattern syntax that you
might see. By the end, you’ll see how to use patterns to create powerful and
clear code.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#all-the-places-patterns-may-be-used" id="all-the-places-patterns-may-be-used"><h2>All the Places Patterns May be Used</h2></a>
<p>Patterns pop up in a number of places in Rust, and you’ve been using them a lot
without realizing it! This section is a reference to all the places where
patterns are valid.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#match-arms" id="match-arms"><h3><code>match</code> Arms</h3></a>
<p>As we discussed in Chapter 6, patterns are used in the arms of <code>match</code>
expressions. Formally, <code>match</code> expressions are defined as the keyword <code>match</code>,
a value to match on, and one or more match arms that consist of a pattern and
an expression to run if the value matches that arm’s pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">match VALUE {
    PATTERN =&gt; EXPRESSION,
    PATTERN =&gt; EXPRESSION,
    PATTERN =&gt; EXPRESSION,
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>match</code> expressions are required to be <em>exhaustive</em>, in the sense that all
possibilities for the value in the <code>match</code> expression must be accounted for.
One way to ensure you have every possibility covered is to have a catch-all
pattern for the last arm---for example, a variable name matching any value can
never fail and thus covers every case remaining.</p>
<p>There’s a particular pattern <code>_</code> that will match anything, but never binds to a
variable, and so is often used in the last match arm. This can be useful when
you want to ignore any value not specified, for example. We’ll cover this in
more detail later in this chapter.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#conditional-if-let-expressions" id="conditional-if-let-expressions"><h3>Conditional <code>if let</code> Expressions</h3></a>
<p>In Chapter 6 we discussed how <code>if let</code> expressions are used mainly as a shorter
way to write the equivalent of a <code>match</code> that only cares about matching one
case. Optionally,<code>if let</code> can have a corresponding <code>else</code> with code to run if
the pattern in the <code>if let</code> doesn’t match.</p>
<!-- Can you say up front why we'd use this, and not just a match? I've just
added something here, not sure if it's right -->
<!-- The first sentence says why-- it's a shorter way to write a `match` when
there's only one case we care about. Can you elaborate on why that's not clear
or up front? /Carol -->
<p>Listing 18-1 shows that it’s also possible to mix and match <code>if let</code>, <code>else if</code>, and <code>else if let</code> expressions. This gives us more flexibility than a
<code>match</code> expression where we can only express one value to compare with the
patterns; the conditions in a series of <code>if let</code>/<code>else if</code>/<code>else if let</code> arms
aren’t required to have any relation to each other.</p>
<p>The code in Listing 18-1 shows a series of checks for a bunch of different
conditions that decide what the background color should be. For the purposes of
the example, we’ve created variables with hardcoded values that a real program
might get by asking the user.</p>
<p>If the user has specified a favorite color, that is used as the background
color. If today is Tuesday, the background color will be green. If the user has
specified their age as a string and we can parse it as a number successfully,
we’ll use either purple or orange depending on the value of the parsed number.
Finally, if none of these conditions apply, the background color will be blue:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let favorite_color: Option&lt;&amp;str&gt; = None;
    let is_tuesday = false;
    let age: Result&lt;u8, _&gt; = &quot;34&quot;.parse();

    if let Some(color) = favorite_color {
        println!(&quot;Using your favorite color, {}, as the background&quot;, color);
    } else if is_tuesday {
        println!(&quot;Tuesday is green day!&quot;);
    } else if let Ok(age) = age {
        if age &gt; 30 {
            println!(&quot;Using purple as the background color&quot;);
        } else {
            println!(&quot;Using orange as the background color&quot;);
        }
    } else {
        println!(&quot;Using blue as the background color&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-1: Mixing <code>if let</code>, <code>else if</code>, <code>else if let</code>,
and <code>else</code></span></p>
<p>This conditional structure lets us support complex requirements. With the
hardcoded values we have here, this example will print <code>Using purple as the background color</code>.</p>
<p>We can see that <code>if let</code> can also introduce shadowed variables, in the same way
that <code>match</code> arms can: <code>if let Ok(age) = age</code> introduces a new shadowed <code>age</code>
variable that contains the value inside the <code>Ok</code> variant. This means we need to
place the <code>if age &gt; 30</code> condition within that block; we can’t combine these two
conditions into <code>if let Ok(age) = age &amp;&amp; age &gt; 30</code> because the shadowed <code>age</code>
we want to compare to 30 isn’t valid until the new scope starts with the curly
brace.</p>
<p>The downside of using <code>if let</code> expressions in this way is that exhaustiveness
is not checked by the compiler, whereas with <code>match</code> expressions it is. If we
left off the last <code>else</code> block and so missed handling some cases, the compiler
would not alert us of the possible logic bug.</p>
<!-- So what would happen, we'd just end up with a program that wasn't correct,
in the Rust sense? -->
<!-- Yes, we would have a logic bug. /Carol -->
<a class="header" href="print.html#while-let-conditional-loops" id="while-let-conditional-loops"><h3><code>while let</code> Conditional Loops</h3></a>
<p>Similar in construction to <code>if let</code>, the <code>while let</code> conditional loop allows
your <code>while</code> loop to run for as long as a pattern continues to match. The
example in Listing 18-2 shows a <code>while let</code> loop that uses a vector as a stack
and prints out the values in the vector in the opposite order they were pushed
in:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut stack = Vec::new();

stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);
stack.push(3);

while let Some(top) = stack.pop() {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, top);
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-2: Using a <code>while let</code> loop to print out
values for as long as <code>stack.pop()</code> returns <code>Some</code></span></p>
<!-- Some lovely simple, but edifying, examples in this chapter!-->
<p>This example will print 3, 2, then 1. The <code>pop</code> method takes the last element
out of the vector and returns <code>Some(value)</code>. If the vector is empty, it returns
<code>None</code>. The <code>while</code> loop will continue running the code in its block as long as
<code>pop</code> is returning <code>Some</code>. Once it returns <code>None</code>, the loop stops. We can use

<p>In Chapter 3 we mentioned that the <code>for</code> loop is the most common loop
construction in Rust code, but we haven’t yet discussed the pattern that <code>for</code>
takes. In a <code>for</code> loop, the pattern is the value that directly follows the
keyword <code>for</code>, so the <code>x</code> in <code>for x in y</code>.</p>
<!-- Can you check the line I added above? I think it'd help to point out the
pattern section of a for loop straight away -->
<!-- Yep, looks good! /Carol -->
<p>Listing 18-3 demonstrates how to use a pattern in a <code>for</code> loop to destructure,
or break apart, a tuple as part of the <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<!-- Liz: We've been using the word "destructure" throughout the book in
chapters 3, 4, 5, and 16. In chapter 3, in the "Grouping Values into Tuples"
section, we said "This is called *destructuring*, because it breaks the single
tuple into three parts.". So I don't think we need to define destructure again
in this chapter, but I've added a small parenthetical here in case the reader
forgets. /Carol -->
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

for (index, value) in v.iter().enumerate() {
    println!(&quot;{} is at index {}&quot;, value, index);
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-3: Using a pattern in a <code>for</code> loop to
destructure a tuple</span></p>
<p>This will print:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">1 is at index 0
2 is at index 1
3 is at index 2
</code></pre>
<p>We use the <code>enumerate</code> method to adapt an iterator to produce a value and that
value’s index in the iterator, placed into a tuple. The first call to
<code>enumerate</code> produces the tuple <code>(0, 1)</code>. When this value is matched to the
pattern <code>(index, value)</code>, <code>index</code> will be 0 and <code>value</code> will be 1, printing our
first line of output.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#let-statements" id="let-statements"><h3><code>let</code> Statements</h3></a>
<p>Before this chapter, we’d only explicitly discussed using patterns with <code>match</code>
and <code>if let</code>, but in fact we’ve used patterns in other places too, including
<code>let</code> statements. For example, consider this straightforward variable
assignment with <code>let</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let x = 5;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We’ve done this hundreds of times throughout this book, and though you may not
have realized it, you were using patterns! A <code>let</code> statement looks like this,
more formally:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">let PATTERN = EXPRESSION;
</code></pre>
<p>In statements like <code>let x = 5;</code> with a variable name in the <code>PATTERN</code> slot, the
variable name is just a particularly humble form of pattern. We compare the
expression against the pattern, and assign any names we find. So for our <code>let x = 5;</code> example, <code>x</code> is a pattern that says “bind what matches here to the
variable <code>x</code>.” And since the name <code>x</code> is the whole pattern, this pattern
effectively means “bind everything to the variable <code>x</code>, whatever the value is.”</p>
<p>To see the pattern matching aspect of <code>let</code> a bit more clearly, consider
Listing 18-4 where we’re using a pattern with <code>let</code> to destructure a tuple:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-4: Using a pattern to destructure a tuple and
create three variables at once</span></p>
<p>Here, we match a tuple against a pattern. Rust compares the value <code>(1, 2, 3)</code>
to the pattern <code>(x, y, z)</code> and sees that the value matches the pattern, so will
bind <code>1</code> to <code>x</code>, <code>2</code> to <code>y</code>, and <code>3</code> to <code>z</code>. You can think of this tuple
pattern as nesting three individual variable patterns inside of it.</p>
<!-- so if we have a pattern of four elements, say (w, x, y, z), but only three
values, would the values would not bind at all? -->
<!-- Either too many or too few elements in the pattern is a type error. I've
added a small example below to illustrate. /Carol -->
<p>If the number of elements in the pattern don’t match the number of elements in
the tuple, the overall type won’t match and we’ll get a compiler error. For
example, Listing 18-5 shows an attempt to destructure into two variables a
tuple with three elements that won’t work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let (x, y) = (1, 2, 3);
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-5: Incorrectly constructing a pattern whose
variables don’t match the number of elements in the tuple</span></p>
<p>Attempting to compile this code gives us this type error:</p>

  |         ^^^^^^ expected a tuple with 3 elements, found one with 2 elements
  |
  = note: expected type `({integer}, {integer}, {integer})`
             found type `(_, _)`
</code></pre>
<p>If we wanted to ignore one or more of the values in the tuple, we could use <code>_</code>
or <code>..</code> as we’ll see in the “Ignoring Values in a Pattern” section. If the
problem was that we had too many variables in the pattern, the solution would
be to make the types match by removing variables so that the number of
variables is equal to the number of elements in the tuple.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#function-parameters-1" id="function-parameters-1"><h3>Function Parameters</h3></a>
<p>Function parameters can also be patterns. The code in Listing 18-6, declaring a
function named <code>foo</code> that takes one parameter named <code>x</code> of type <code>i32</code>, should
by now look familiar:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn foo(x: i32) {
    // code goes here
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-6: A function signature uses patterns in the
parameters</span></p>
<p>The <code>x</code> part is a pattern! Like we did with <code>let</code>, we could match a tuple in a
function’s arguments to the pattern. Listing 18-7 splits apart the values in a
tuple as we pass it to a function:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn print_coordinates(&amp;(x, y): &amp;(i32, i32)) {
    println!(&quot;Current location: ({}, {})&quot;, x, y);
}

fn main() {
    let point = (3, 5);
    print_coordinates(&amp;point);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-7: A function with parameters that destructure
a tuple</span></p>
<p>This will print <code>Current location: (3, 5)</code>. The values <code>&amp;(3, 5)</code> match the
pattern <code>&amp;(x, y)</code>, so <code>x</code> gets the value 3, and <code>y</code> gets the value 5.</p>
<p>We can use patterns in closure parameter lists in the same way, too, because
closures are similar to functions, as we discussed in Chapter 13.</p>
<p>We’ve seen several ways of using patterns now, but patterns do not work the
same in every place we can use them; in some places, the patterns must be
<em>irrefutable</em>, meaning they must match any value provided. In other
circumstances, they may be refutable. Let’s discuss that next.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#refutability-whether-a-pattern-might-fail-to-match" id="refutability-whether-a-pattern-might-fail-to-match"><h2>Refutability: Whether a Pattern Might Fail to Match</h2></a>
<p>Patterns come in two forms: refutable and irrefutable. Patterns that will match
for any possible value passed are said to be <em>irrefutable</em>. An example would be
<code>x</code> in the statement <code>let x = 5;</code> because <code>x</code> matches anything and so cannot
fail to match. Patterns that may fail to match for some possible value are said
to be <em>refutable</em>. An example of this would be <code>Some(x)</code> in the expression <code>if let Some(x) = a_value</code>; if the value in the <code>a_value</code> variable is <code>None</code> rather
than <code>Some</code>, then the <code>Some(x)</code> pattern would not match.</p>
<p><code>let</code> statements, function parameters, and <code>for</code> loops can only accept
irrefutable patterns, because the program cannot do anything
meaningful with values that don’t match. The <code>if let</code> and <code>while let</code>
expressions are restricted to only accept refutable patterns, because by
definition they’re intended to handle possible failure---the functionality of a
conditional is in its ability to perform differently upon success and failure.</p>
<p>In general, you shouldn’t have to worry about the distinction between refutable
and irrefutable patterns, but you do need to be familiar with the concept of
refutability so you can respond when you see it in an error message. In those
cases, you’ll need to change either the pattern or the construct you’re using
the pattern with, depending on your intentions for the behavior of the code.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example of what happens if we try to use a refutable pattern
where Rust requires an irrefutable pattern and vice versa. In Listing 18-8, we
have a <code>let</code> statement, but for the pattern we’ve specified <code>Some(x)</code>, a
refutable pattern. As you might expect, this will error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let Some(x) = some_option_value;
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-8: Attempting to use a refutable pattern with
<code>let</code></span></p>
<p>If <code>some_option_value</code> was a <code>None</code> value, it would fail to match the pattern
<code>Some(x)</code>, meaning the pattern is refutable. The <code>let</code> statement, however, can
only accept an irrefutable patterns because there’s nothing valid the code
could do with a <code>None</code> value. At compile time, Rust will complain that we’ve
tried to use a refutable pattern where an irrefutable pattern is required:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding: `None` not covered
 --&gt; &lt;anon&gt;:3:5
  |
3 | let Some(x) = some_option_value;
  |     ^^^^^^^ pattern `None` not covered
</code></pre>
<p>We didn’t cover (and couldn’t cover!) every valid value with the pattern
<code>Some(x)</code>, so Rust will rightfully complain.</p>
<p>To fix the case where we have a refutable pattern in a place where an
irrefutable pattern is needed, we can change the code that uses the pattern:
instead of using <code>let</code>, we can use <code>if let</code>. That way, if the pattern doesn’t
match, the code will just skip the code in the curly brackets, giving it a way
to continue validly. Listing 18-9 shows how to fix the code in Listing 18-8.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# let some_option_value: Option&lt;i32&gt; = None;
if let Some(x) = some_option_value {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x);
}
#}</code></pre></pre>

<!-- Sorry, that line has to do with the way we test our code examples and I

-->
<p>We’ve given the code an out! This code is perfectly valid, though does now of
course mean we cannot use an irrefutable pattern without receiving an error. If
we give <code>if let</code> a pattern that will always match, such as <code>x</code> as shown in
Listing 18-10, it will error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">if let x = 5 {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x);
};
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-10: Attempting to use an irrefutable pattern

<p>For this reason, match arms must use refutable patterns, except for the last
arm that should match any remaining values with an irrefutable pattern. Using
an irrefutable pattern in a <code>match</code> with only one arm is allowed, but isn’t
particularly useful and could be replaced with a simpler <code>let</code> statement.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve discussed where patterns can be used and the difference between
refutable and irrefutable patterns, let’s go over all the syntax we can use to
create patterns.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#all-the-pattern-syntax" id="all-the-pattern-syntax"><h2>All the Pattern Syntax</h2></a>

just add a line to each, since we've promised it, and just to really hammer the
point home. Definitely keep it short and sweet though, where it's pretty clear.
-->
<a class="header" href="print.html#matching-literals" id="matching-literals"><h3>Matching Literals</h3></a>
<p>As we saw in Chapter 6, you can match patterns against literals directly. This
following code gives some examples:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let x = 1;

match x {
    1 =&gt; println!(&quot;one&quot;),
    2 =&gt; println!(&quot;two&quot;),
    3 =&gt; println!(&quot;three&quot;),
    _ =&gt; println!(&quot;anything&quot;),
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This prints <code>one</code> since the value in <code>x</code> is 1. This is useful when you want to
take some action if you get a concrete value in particular.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#matching-named-variables" id="matching-named-variables"><h3>Matching Named Variables</h3></a>
<!-- I found this next bit a little tougher to follow, I've tried to clarify in
this opening paragraph, connect it all up, can you please check it? -->
<!-- Yep! Looks good! /Carol -->
<p>Named variables are irrefutable patterns that match any value, which we have
used many times before. There is a complication, however, when used in <code>match</code>
expressions. Because <code>match</code> starts a new scope, variables declared as part of
a pattern inside the <code>match</code> expression will shadow those with the same name
outside the <code>match</code> construct---as is the case with all variables. In Listing
18-11, we declare a variable named <code>x</code> with the value <code>Some(5)</code> and a variable
<code>y</code> with the value <code>10</code>. We then create a <code>match</code> expression on the value <code>x</code>.
Take a look at the patterns in the match arms and <code>println!</code> at the end, and
try to figure out what will be printed before running this code or reading
further:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x = Some(5);
    let y = 10;

    match x {
        Some(50) =&gt; println!(&quot;Got 50&quot;),
        Some(y) =&gt; println!(&quot;Matched, y = {:?}&quot;, y),
        _ =&gt; println!(&quot;Default case, x = {:?}&quot;, x),
    }

    println!(&quot;at the end: x = {:?}, y = {:?}&quot;, x, y);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-11: A <code>match</code> statement with an arm that
introduces a shadowed variable <code>y</code></span></p>
<p>Let’s walk through what happens when the <code>match</code> statement runs. The pattern in
the first match arm does not match the defined value of <code>x</code>, so we continue.</p>
<p>The pattern in the second match arm introduces a new variable name <code>y</code> that
will match any value inside a <code>Some</code> value. Because we’re in a new scope inside
the <code>match</code> expression, this is a new variable, and not the <code>y</code> we declared at
the beginning with the value 10. This new <code>y</code> binding will match any value
inside a <code>Some</code>, which is what we have in <code>x</code>. Therefore this <code>y</code> binds to the
inner value of the <code>Some</code> in <code>x</code>. That value is 5, and so the expression for
that arm executes and prints <code>Matched, y = 5</code>.</p>
<!-- Below -- We haven't fully introduced the underscore yet, is there anything
else we could use for that final arm? -->
<!-- We have *used* the underscore briefly before, though-- we actually
introduced the underscore in chapter 6. There really isn't anything else that
we can put that will still have this example illustrating what we want to
illustrate. /Carol -->
<p>If <code>x</code> had been a <code>None</code> value instead of <code>Some(5)</code>, the patterns in the first
two arms would not have matched, so we would have matched to the underscore. We
did not introduce the <code>x</code> variable in the pattern of that arm, so the <code>x</code> in
the expression is still the outer <code>x</code> that has not been shadowed. In this
hypothetical case, the <code>match</code> would print <code>Default case, x = None</code>.</p>
<p>Once the <code>match</code> expression is over, its scope ends, and so does the scope of
the inner <code>y</code>. The last <code>println!</code> produces <code>at the end: x = Some(5), y = 10</code>.</p>
<p>To create a <code>match</code> expression that compares the values of the outer <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code>, rather than introducing a shadowed variable, we would need to use a match
guard conditional instead. We’ll be talking about match guards later in this
section.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#multiple-patterns" id="multiple-patterns"><h3>Multiple Patterns</h3></a>
<p>In <code>match</code> expressions you can match multiple patterns using the <code>|</code> syntax,
which means <em>or</em>. For example, the following code matches the value of <code>x</code>
against the match arms, the first of which has an <em>or</em> option, meaning if the
value of <code>x</code> matches either of the values in that arm, it will run:</p>
<!-- I've tried to flesh this out a bit, can you check? -->
<!-- Yep, it's fine! /Carol -->

    3 =&gt; println!(&quot;three&quot;),
    _ =&gt; println!(&quot;anything&quot;),
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This code will print <code>one or two</code>.</p>
<!-- Is there a corresponding "and" operator? Is that worth tacking on here? -->
<!-- No, there is not-- how could one value match, say, 1 AND 2? Does it make
sense why there isn't an "and" operator? /Carol -->
<a class="header" href="print.html#matching-ranges-of-values-with-" id="matching-ranges-of-values-with-"><h3>Matching Ranges of Values with <code>...</code></h3></a>
<p>The <code>...</code> syntax allows you to match to an inclusive range of values. In the
following code, when a pattern matches any of the values within the range,
that arm will execute:</p>
<!-- Above--this seems like it's true, that the range allows you to match to
just one of the values? If so, can you say how this differs to using the or
operator? -->
<!-- I'm not sure what you mean by "match to just one of the values". `...`
matches any value between the two specified endpoints, which I thought would be
clear by the text below the code, and I changed "just one of" to "any of the
values within" above, and mentioned what the equivalent "or" pattern would look
like below. Does that clear it up? /Carol -->
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">

}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If <code>x</code> is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, the first arm will match. This is more convenient
than using the <code>|</code> operator to express the same idea; instead of <code>1 ... 5</code> we
would have to specify <code>1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5</code> using <code>|</code>. Specifying a range instead
is much shorter, especially if we wanted to match, say, any number between 1
and 1,000!</p>
<p>Ranges are only allowed with numeric values or <code>char</code> values, because the
compiler checks that the range isn’t empty at compile time. <code>char</code> and numeric
values are the only types that Rust knows how to tell if a range is empty or
not.</p>

<p>This code creates the variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> that match the values of the <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code> fields of the <code>p</code> variable.</p>
<p>This example shows that the names of the variable names in the pattern don’t
have to match the field names of the struct, but it’s common to want the
variable names to match the field names to make it easier to remember which
variables came from which fields. Because having variable names match the
fields is common, and because writing <code>let Point { x: x, y: y } = p;</code> contains
a lot of duplication, there’s a shorthand for patterns that match struct
fields: you only need to list the name of the struct field, and the variables
created from the pattern will have the same names. Listing 18-13 shows code
that behaves in the same way as the code in Listing 18-12, but the variables

<p>The first arm will match any point that lies on the <code>x</code> axis by specifying that
the <code>y</code> field matches if its value matches the literal <code>0</code>. The pattern still
creates an <code>x</code> variable that we can use in the code for this arm. Similarly,
the second arm matches any point on the <code>y</code> axis by specifying that the <code>x</code>
field matches if its value is <code>0</code>, and creates a variable <code>y</code> for the value of
the <code>y</code> field. The third arm doesn’t specify any literals, so it matches any
other <code>Point</code> and creates variables for both the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> fields.</p>
<p>In this example, the value <code>p</code> matches the second arm by virtue of <code>x</code>
containing a 0, so this will print <code>On the y axis at 7</code>.</p>

<p>We’ve destructured enums before in this book, like in Listing 6-5 in Chapter 6
when we destructured an <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code>. One detail we haven’t mentioned
explicitly is that the pattern to destructure an enum should correspond to the
way the data stored within the enum is defined. For example, let’s take the
<code>Message</code> enum from Listing 6-2 and write a <code>match</code> with patterns that will
destructure each inner value in Listing 18-15:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">enum Message {

    let msg = Message::ChangeColor(0, 160, 255);

    match msg {
        Message::Quit =&gt; {

    }

</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-15: Destructuring enum variants that hold
different kinds of values</span></p>
<p>This code will print <code>Change the color to red 0, green 160, and blue 255</code>. Try
changing the value of <code>msg</code> to see the code from the other arms run.</p>
<p>For enum variants without any data like <code>Message::Quit</code>, we can’t destructure
the value any further. We can only match on the literal <code>Message::Quit</code> value,
and there are no variables in that pattern.</p>
<p>For struct-like enum variants such as <code>Message::Move</code>, we can use a pattern
similar to the pattern we specify to match structs. After the variant name, we
place curly brackets and then list the fields with variables so that we break
apart the pieces to use in the code for this arm.</p>
<p>For tuple-like enum variants like <code>Message::Write</code>, that holds a tuple with one
element, and <code>Message::ChangeColor</code> that holds a tuple with three elements, the
pattern is similar to the pattern we specify to match tuples. The number of
variables in the pattern must match the number of elements in the variant we’re
matching.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#destructuring-references" id="destructuring-references"><h4>Destructuring References</h4></a>
<p>When the value we’re matching to our pattern contains a reference, we need to
destructure the reference from the value, which we can do can by specifying a
<code>&amp;</code> in the pattern. This lets us get a variable holding the value that the
reference points to rather than getting a variable that holds the reference.</p>
<!-- What does it mean, to separate the reference and the value, precisely? So
that we specify Rust use the value in place of the reference? And what does &
here do, tell Rust to follow the reference to the value itself, rather than
work on the reference?-->
<!-- Yes, pretty much. I've tried rewording, is this clearer? /Carol -->
<p>This is especially useful in closures where we have iterators that iterate over
references, but we want to use the values in the closure rather than the
references.</p>
<p>The example in Listing 18-16 iterates over references to <code>Point</code> instances in a
vector, and destructures both the reference and the struct so we can perform
calculations on the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values easily:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# struct Point {
#     x: i32,
#     y: i32,
# }
#
let points = vec![
    Point { x: 0, y: 0 },
    Point { x: 1, y: 5 },
    Point { x: 10, y: -3 },
];

let sum_of_squares: i32 = points
    .iter()
    .map(|&amp;Point { x, y }| x * x + y * y)
    .sum();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-16: Destructuring a reference to a struct into
the struct field values</span></p>
<!-- and what do we actually get, instead of the error? -->
<!-- Added explanation text below /Carol -->
<p>This code results in the value 135 in the variable <code>sum_of_squares</code>, which is
the result from squaring the <code>x</code> value and the <code>y</code> value, adding those
together, and then adding the result for each <code>Point</code> in the <code>points</code> vector to
get one number.</p>
<p>If we had not included the <code>&amp;</code> in <code>&amp;Point { x, y }</code> we’d get a type mismatch
error, because <code>iter</code> would then iterate over references to the items in the
vector rather than the values themselves. The error would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --&gt;
   |
14 |         .map(|Point { x, y }| x * x + y * y)
   |               ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected &amp;Point, found struct `Point`
   |
   = note: expected type `&amp;Point`
              found type `Point`
</code></pre>
<p>This tells us that Rust was expecting our closure to match <code>&amp;Point</code>, but we
tried to match directly to a <code>Point</code> value, and not a reference to a <code>Point</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#destructuring-structs-and-tuples" id="destructuring-structs-and-tuples"><h4>Destructuring Structs and Tuples</h4></a>
<p>We can mix, match, and nest destructuring patterns in even more complex way.
Here’s an example of a complicated destructure, where we nest structs and
tuples inside a tuple, and destructure all the primitive values out:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# struct Point {
#     x: i32,
#     y: i32,
# }
#
let ((feet, inches), Point {x, y}) = ((3, 10), Point { x: 3, y: -10 });
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This lets us break complex types into their component parts so that we can use
the values we’re interested in separately.</p>
<!-- Can you round up the destructuring section here before we move on. For
this bit, maybe say explicitly what this would be useful for -->
<!-- Done /Carol -->
<p>Destructuring with patterns is a convenient way to use pieces of values, such
as the value from each field in a struct, separately from each other.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#ignoring-values-in-a-pattern" id="ignoring-values-in-a-pattern"><h3>Ignoring Values in a Pattern</h3></a>
<p>We’ve seen that it’s sometimes useful to ignore values in a pattern, such as in
the last arm of a <code>match</code> to give us a catch-all that doesn’t actually do
anything, but does account for all remaining possible values. There are a few
ways to ignore entire values or parts of values in a pattern: using the <code>_</code>
pattern (which we’ve seen), using the <code>_</code> pattern within another pattern, using
a name that starts with an underscore, or using <code>..</code> to ignore remaining parts
of a value. Let’s explore how and why to do each of these.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#ignoring-an-entire-value-with-_" id="ignoring-an-entire-value-with-_"><h4>Ignoring an Entire Value with <code>_</code></h4></a>
<p>We’ve used the underscore as a wildcard pattern that will match any value but
not bind to the value. While the underscore pattern is especially useful as the
last arm in a <code>match</code> expression, we can use it in any pattern, including
function parameters, as shown in Listing 18-17:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn foo(_: i32, y: i32) {
    println!(&quot;This code only uses the y parameter: {}&quot;, y);
}

fn main() {
    foo(3, 4);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-17: Using <code>_</code> in a function signature</span></p>
<!-- What is this doing exactly, can you help the reader out here? Are we
letting the function run without a parameter at all? I'm not sure the purpose
clear enough at the moment -->
<!-- Done /Carol -->
<p>This code will completely ignore the value passed as the first argument, 3, and
will print out <code>This code only uses the y parameter: 4</code>. In most cases when you
no longer need a particular function parameter, you would change the signature
so it doesn’t include the unused parameter.</p>
<p>Ignoring a function parameter can be especially useful in some cases, such as
when implementing a trait, when you need a certain type signature but the
function body in your implementation doesn’t need one of the parameters. The
compiler will then not warn about unused function parameters, as it would if we
used a name instead.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#ignoring-parts-of-a-value-with-a-nested-_" id="ignoring-parts-of-a-value-with-a-nested-_"><h4>Ignoring Parts of a Value with a Nested <code>_</code></h4></a>
<!-- When would we want to do this? -->
<!-- Done, moved the explanation up and made the example have a bit more
motivation /Carol -->
<p>We can also use <code>_</code> inside of another pattern to ignore just part of a value,
when we only want to test for part of a value but have no use for the other
parts in the corresponding code we want to run. Listing 18-18 shows code
responsible for giving a setting a value. The business requirements are that
the user should not be allowed to overwrite an existing customization of a
setting, but can unset the setting and can give the setting a value if it is
currently unset.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut setting_value = Some(5);
let new_setting_value = Some(10);

match (setting_value, new_setting_value) {
    (Some(_), Some(_)) =&gt; {
        println!(&quot;Can't overwrite an existing customized value&quot;);
    }
    _ =&gt; {
        setting_value = new_setting_value;
    }
}

println!(&quot;setting is {:?}&quot;, setting_value);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-18: Using an underscore within patterns that
match <code>Some</code> variants when we don’t need to use the value inside the
<code>Some</code></span></p>
<p>This code will print <code>Can't overwrite an existing customized value</code> and then
<code>setting is Some(5)</code>. In the first match arm, we don’t need to match on or use
the values inside either <code>Some</code> variant; the important part we need to test for
is the case when both <code>setting_value</code> and <code>new_setting_value</code> are the <code>Some</code>
variant. In that case, we want to print out why we’re not changing
<code>setting_value</code>, and we don’t change it.</p>
<p>In all other cases (if either <code>setting_value</code> or <code>new_setting_value</code> are
<code>None</code>), which is expressed by the <code>_</code> pattern in the second arm, we do want to
allow <code>new_setting_value</code> to become <code>setting_value</code>.</p>
<!-- So when we need to match but don't actually need the value, is that what
we're saying? -->
<!-- Yes /Carol -->
<p>We can also use underscores in multiple places within one pattern to ignore
particular values, as shown in Listing 18-19 where we’re ignoring the second
and fourth values in a tuple of five items:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]

    },
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-19: Ignoring multiple parts of a tuple</span></p>

<p>If you create a variable but don’t use it anywhere, Rust will usually issue a
warning, since that could be a bug. Sometimes, though, it’s useful to create a
variable you won’t use yet, like if you’re prototyping or just starting a
project. In this situation you’ll want to tell Rust not to warn you about the
unused variable, which you can do by starting the name of the variable with an
underscore. In Listing 18-20 we create two unused variables, but when we run
this code we should only get a warning about one of them.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {

<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-20: Starting a variable name with an
underscore in order to not get unused variable warnings</span></p>
<p>Here we get a warning about not using the variable <code>y</code>, but not about not using
the variable preceded by the underscore.</p>
<p>Note that there is a subtle difference between using only <code>_</code> and using a name
that starts with an underscore. Something like <code>_x</code> still binds the value to
the variable, whereas <code>_</code> doesn’t bind at all. To show a case where this
distinction matters, Listing 18-21 will provide us with an error.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let s = Some(String::from(&quot;Hello!&quot;));

if let Some(_s) = s {

</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-21: An unused variable starting with an
underscore still binds the value, which may take ownership of the value</span></p>
<p>We’ll receive an error because the <code>s</code> value will still be moved into <code>_s</code>,
which prevents us from using <code>s</code> again. Using the underscore by itself,
however, doesn’t ever bind to the value. Listing 18-22 will compile without any
errors since <code>s</code> does not get moved into <code>_</code>:</p>

<p>With values that have many parts, we can use the <code>..</code> syntax to use only a few
parts and ignore the rest, while avoiding having to list underscores for each
ignored value. The <code>..</code> pattern will ignore any parts of a value that we
haven’t explicitly matched in the rest of the pattern. In Listing 18-23, we
have a <code>Point</code> struct that holds a coordinate in three dimensional space. In
the <code>match</code> expression, we want to operate only on the <code>x</code> coordinate and
ignore the values in the <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> fields:</p>

are relevant.</p>
<p><code>..</code> will expand to as many values as it needs to be. Listing 18-24 shows a use

ignore 2 and 4, bind <code>second</code> to 8, then ignore 16 and 32, and so forth. The
variable name <code>second</code> doesn’t mean anything special to Rust, so we get a

<p>Here we’ll look at using <code>ref</code> to make references so ownership of the values
isn’t moved to variables in the pattern. Usually, when you match against a
pattern, the variables introduced by the pattern are bound to a value. Rust’s
ownership rules mean the value will be moved into the <code>match</code>, or wherever
you’re using the pattern. Listing 18-26 shows an example of a <code>match</code> that has
a pattern with a variable, and then another usage of the entire value after the
<code>match</code>. This will fail to compile because ownership of part of the
<code>robot_name</code> value is transferred to the <code>name</code> variable in the pattern of the
first <code>match</code> arm:</p>
<!-- Can you lay out what is supposed to happen with this code, that doesn't
work? -->
<!-- Done /Carol -->
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let robot_name = Some(String::from(&quot;Bors&quot;));

println!(&quot;robot_name is: {:?}&quot;, robot_name);
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-26: Creating a variable in a match arm pattern
takes ownership of the value</span></p>
<p>This example will fail because the value inside <code>Some</code> in <code>robot_name</code> is moved
to within the <code>match</code> when <code>name</code> binds to that value. Because ownership of
part of <code>robot_name</code> has been moved to <code>name</code>, we can no longer use
<code>robot_name</code> in the <code>println!</code> after the <code>match</code> because <code>robot_name</code> no longer
has ownership.</p>
<!-- Above -- why will that make it fail, because the bind is then invalid? -->
<!-- Yes, I've clarified a bit /Carol -->
<!--Below -- Is this then the solution, introducing &? I assume so, because we
don’t have & in the example above, but the connection isn't clear -->
<!-- No, the solution is introducing `ref`. I've clarified /Carol -->
<p>In order to fix this code, we want to have the <code>Some(name)</code> pattern borrow that
part of <code>robot_name</code> rather than taking ownership. Outside of patterns, we’ve
seen that the way to borrow a value is to create a reference using <code>&amp;</code>, so you
may think the solution is changing <code>Some(name)</code> to <code>Some(&amp;name)</code>.</p>
<p>However, we saw in the “Destructuring to Break Apart Values” section that <code>&amp;</code>
in patterns does not <em>create</em> a reference, it <em>matches</em> an existing reference
in the value. Because <code>&amp;</code> already has that meaning in patterns, we can’t use
<code>&amp;</code> to create a reference in a pattern.</p>
<p>Instead, to create a reference in a pattern, we do this by using the <code>ref</code>
keyword before the new variable, as shown in Listing 18-27:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]

    None =&gt; (),
}

println!(&quot;robot_name is: {:?}&quot;, robot_name);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-27: Creating a reference so that a pattern
variable does not take ownership of a value</span></p>
<p>This example will compile because the value in the <code>Some</code> variant in
<code>robot_name</code> is not moved into the <code>match</code>; the <code>match</code> only took a reference
to the data in <code>robot_name</code> rather than moving it.</p>
<p>To create a mutable reference in order to be able to mutate a value matched in
a pattern, use <code>ref mut</code> instead of <code>&amp;mut</code> for the same reason that we use
<code>ref</code> instead of <code>&amp;</code>: <code>&amp;mut</code> in patterns is for matching existing mutable
references, not creating new ones. Listing 18-28 shows an example of a pattern
creating a mutable reference:</p>

}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-29: Adding a match guard to a pattern</span></p>
<p>This example will print <code>less than five: 4</code>. When <code>num</code> is compared to the
pattern in the first arm, it matches since <code>Some(4)</code> matches <code>Some(x)</code>. Then
the match guard checks to see if the value in <code>x</code> is less than 5, and because 4
is less than 5, the first arm is selected.</p>
<p>If <code>num</code> had been <code>Some(10)</code> instead, the match guard in the first arm would
have been false since 10 is not less than 5. Rust would then go to the second
arm, which would match because the second arm does not have a match guard and
therefore matches any <code>Some</code> variant.</p>
<p>There’s no way to express the <code>if x &lt; 5</code> condition within a pattern, so the
match guard has given us the ability to express this logic.</p>
<!-- I think we need this spelled out, can you say what it is the match guard
is doing here? I've had a guess above, but I think it needs your review! -->
<!-- Reviewed and tweaked a bit! /Carol -->
<p>In Listing 18-11, we mentioned that we could use match guards to solve our
pattern shadowing problem, where a new variable was created inside the pattern
in the <code>match</code> expression instead of using the variable outside the <code>match</code>.
That new variable meant we couldn’t test against the value that the outer
variable had. Listing 18-30 shows how we can use a match guard to fix this:</p>
<!-- Can you check this above -- I've tried to paraphrase the final paragraph
from that section. -->
<!-- Checked and reworded a bit /Carol -->

    let x = Some(5);

        Some(50) =&gt; println!(&quot;Got 50&quot;),
        Some(n) if n == y =&gt; println!(&quot;Matched, n = {:?}&quot;, n),
        _ =&gt; println!(&quot;Default case, x = {:?}&quot;, x),
    }

    println!(&quot;at the end: x = {:?}, y = {:?}&quot;, x, y);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-30: Using a match guard to test for equality
with an outer variable</span></p>
<p>This will now print <code>Default case, x = Some(5)</code>. The pattern in the second
match arm is now not introducing a new variable <code>y</code> that would shadow the outer
<code>y</code>, meaning we can use the outer <code>y</code> in the match guard. Instead of specifying
the pattern as <code>Some(y)</code>, which would have shadowed the outer <code>y</code>, we specify
<code>Some(n)</code>. This creates a new variable <code>n</code> that does not shadow anything
because there is no <code>n</code> variable outside the <code>match</code>.</p>
<p>In the match guard, <code>if n == y</code>, this is not a pattern and therefore does not
introduce new variables. This <code>y</code> <em>is</em> the outer <code>y</code> rather than a new shadowed
<code>y</code>, and we can express the idea that we’re looking for a value that has the
same value as the outer <code>y</code> by comparing <code>n</code> to <code>y</code>.</p>
<!-- Why is this one not introducing a new variable y but 18-10 was? Instead we
create a new variable n and then compare it to the outer y, is that it? In
which case, I'm not understanding how we get n from destructuring x, can you
lay this out?-->
<!-- I've elaborated a bit, does this clear it up? /Carol -->
<p>You can also use the or operator <code>|</code> in a match guard to specify multiple
patterns, and the match guard condition will apply to all of the patterns.
Listing 18-31 shows the precedence of combining a match guard with a pattern
that uses <code>|</code>. The important part of this example is that the <code>if y</code> match
guard applies to 4, 5, <em>and</em> 6, even though it might look like <code>if y</code> only
applies to 6:</p>
<!-- What's the match condition actually doing here, with y having a value of
`false`? Can you let us know how that's being applied to all the values in that
match arm? -->
<!-- The point of the example here is to illustrate operator precedence, that
this code might look like it's saying `4 | 5 | (6 if y)` but it's actually
saying `(4 | 5 | 6) if y`. I've tried to elaborate above and below, does that
make sense now? /Carol -->
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">

}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-31: Combining multiple patterns with a match
guard</span></p>
<p>The match condition states that the arm only matches if the value of <code>x</code> is
equal to 4, 5, or 6 <em>and</em> if <code>y</code> is <code>true</code>. What happens when this code runs is
that the pattern of the first arm matches because <code>x</code> is 4, but the match guard
<code>if y</code> is false, so the first arm is not chosen. The code moves on to the
second arm, which does match, and this program prints <code>no</code>.</p>
<!-- Is this what we mean, if 4 or 5 or 6 being equal to x is false, run the
first arm? And so, because it's applying that to all of the values (including
4), the second arm is run and not the first? -->
<!-- It seems like `if y` was confusing, I've tried to spell it out a bit more.
Does this make sense now? /Carol -->
<p>This is because the <code>if</code> condition applies to the whole pattern <code>4 | 5 | 6</code>,
and not only to the last value <code>6</code>. In other words, the precedence of a match
guard in relation to a pattern behaves like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">(4 | 5 | 6) if y =&gt; ...
</code></pre>
<p>rather than this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">4 | 5 | (6 if y) =&gt; ...
</code></pre>
<p>We can tell this from what happened when we ran the code: if the match guard
was only applied to the final value in the list of values specified using the
<code>|</code> operator, the arm would have matched and the program would have printed
<code>yes</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#-bindings" id="-bindings"><h3><code>@</code> Bindings</h3></a>
<!-- Below - use @ to what, can you say explicitly what it does. Also what the
name of the operator is? -->
<!-- I don't think it has a name other than "the at operator". And we tried to
say what it does-- it creates a variable at the same time as letting us test
it, I've tried rewording a bit but I'm not sure why that wasn't explicit
enough, can you clarify if this still doesn't make sense? /Carol -->
<p>The at operator, <code>@</code>, lets us create a variable that holds a value at the same
time we’re testing that value to see if it matches a pattern. Listing 18-32
shows an example where we want to test that a <code>Message::Hello</code> <code>id</code> field is
within the range <code>3...7</code> but also be able to bind the value to the variable
<code>id_variable</code> so that we can use it in the code associated with the arm. We
could have named <code>id_variable</code> <code>id</code>, the same as the field, but for the
purposes of this example we’ve chosen to give it a different name:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
enum Message {
    Hello { id: i32 },
}

let msg = Message::Hello { id: 5 };

match msg {
    Message::Hello { id: id_variable @ 3...7 } =&gt; {
        println!(&quot;Found an id in range: {}&quot;, id_variable)
    },
    Message::Hello { id: 10...12 } =&gt; {
        println!(&quot;Found an id in another range&quot;)
    },
    Message::Hello { id } =&gt; {
        println!(&quot;Found some other id: {}&quot;, id)
    },
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 18-32: Using <code>@</code> to bind to a value in a pattern
while also testing it</span></p>
<p>This example will print <code>Found an id in range: 5</code>. By specifying <code>id_variable @</code> before the range <code>3...7</code>, we’re capturing whatever value matched the range
while also testing that the value matched the range pattern.</p>
<p>In the second arm where we only have a range specified in the pattern, the code
associated with the arm doesn’t have a variable that contains the actual value
of the <code>id</code> field. The <code>id</code> field’s value could have been 10, 11, or 12 but the
code that goes with that pattern doesn’t know which one and isn’t able to use
the value from the <code>id</code> field, because we haven’t saved the <code>id</code> value in a
variable.</p>
<p>In the last arm where we’ve specified a variable without a range, we do have
the value available to use in the arm’s code in a variable named <code>id</code> because
we’ve used the struct field shorthand syntax. We haven’t applied any test to
the value in the <code>id</code> field in this arm, though, like the first two arms did:
any value would match this pattern.</p>
<p>Using <code>@</code> lets us test a value and save it in a variable within one pattern.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#summary-16" id="summary-16"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>Patterns are a useful feature of Rust that help distinguish between different
kinds of data. When used in <code>match</code> statements, Rust makes sure your patterns
cover every possible value, or your program will not compile. Patterns in <code>let</code>
statements and function parameters make those constructs more powerful,
enabling the destructuring of values into smaller parts at the same time as
assigning to variables. We can create simple or complex patterns to suit our
needs.</p>
<p>Now, for the penultimate chapter of the book, let’s take a look at some
advanced parts of a variety of Rust’s features.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#advanced-features" id="advanced-features"><h1>Advanced Features</h1></a>
<p>We’ve come a long way! By now, we’ve learned 99% of the things you’ll need to
know when writing Rust. Before we do one more project in Chapter 20, let’s talk
about a few things that you may run into that last 1% of the time. Feel free to
skip this chapter and come back to it once you run into these things in the
wild; the features we’ll learn to use here are useful in very specific
situations. We don’t want to leave these features out, but you won’t find
yourself reaching for them often.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unsafe Rust: for when you need to opt out of some of Rust’s guarantees and
tell the compiler that you will be responsible for upholding the guarantees
instead</li>
<li>Advanced Lifetimes: Additional lifetime syntax for complex situations</li>
<li>Advanced Traits: Associated Types, default type parameters, fully qualified
syntax, supertraits, and the newtype pattern in relation to traits</li>
<li>Advanced Types: some more about the newtype pattern, type aliases, the
“never” type, and dynamically sized types</li>
<li>Advanced Functions and Closures: function pointers and returning closures</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a panoply of Rust features with something for everyone! Let’s dive in!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#unsafe-rust" id="unsafe-rust"><h2>Unsafe Rust</h2></a>
<p>In all of the previous chapters in this book, we’ve been discussing code
written in Rust that has memory safety guarantees enforced at compile time.
However, Rust has a second language hiding out inside of it, unsafe Rust, which
does not enforce these memory safety guarantees. Unsafe Rust works just like
regular Rust does, but it gives you extra superpowers not available in safe
Rust code.</p>
<p>Unsafe Rust exists because, by nature, static analysis is conservative. When
trying to determine if code upholds some guarantees or not, it’s better to
reject some programs that are valid than it is to accept some programs that are
invalid. There are some times when your code might be okay, but Rust thinks
it’s not! In these cases, you can use unsafe code to tell the compiler, “trust
me, I know what I’m doing.” The downside is that you’re on your own; if you get
unsafe code wrong, problems due to memory unsafety like null pointer
dereferencing can occur.</p>
<p>There’s another reason that Rust needs to have unsafe code: the underlying
hardware of computers is inherently not safe. If Rust didn’t let you do unsafe
operations, there would be some tasks that you simply could not do. But Rust
needs to be able to let you do low-level systems programming like directly
interacting with your operating system, or even writing your own operating
system! That’s part of the goals of the language. We need some way to do these
kinds of things.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#unsafe-superpowers" id="unsafe-superpowers"><h3>Unsafe Superpowers</h3></a>
<p>We switch into unsafe Rust by using the <code>unsafe</code> keyword and starting a new
block that holds the unsafe code. There are four actions that you can take in
unsafe Rust that you can’t in safe Rust. We call these the “unsafe
superpowers.” We haven’t seen most of these features yet since they’re only
usable with <code>unsafe</code>!</p>
<ol>
<li>Dereferencing a raw pointer</li>
<li>Calling an unsafe function or method</li>
<li>Accessing or modifying a mutable static variable</li>
<li>Implementing an unsafe trait</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to understand that <code>unsafe</code> doesn’t turn off the borrow checker
or disable any other of Rust’s safety checks: if you use a reference in unsafe
code, it will still be checked. The only thing the <code>unsafe</code> keyword does is
give you access to these four features that aren’t checked by the compiler for
memory safety. You still get some degree of safety inside of an unsafe block!
Furthermore, <code>unsafe</code> does not mean the code inside the block is dangerous or
definitely will have memory safety problems: the intent is that you as the
programmer will ensure that the code inside an <code>unsafe</code> block will have valid
memory, since you’ve turned off the compiler checks.</p>
<p>People are fallible, however, and mistakes will happen. By requiring these four
unsafe operations to be inside blocks annotated with <code>unsafe</code>, if you make a
mistake and get an error related to memory safety, you’ll know that it has to
be related to one of the places that you opted into this unsafety. That makes
the cause of memory safety bugs much easier to find, since we know Rust is
checking all of the other code for us. To get this benefit of only having a few
places to investigate memory safety bugs, it’s important to contain your unsafe
code to as small of an area as possible. Any code inside of an <code>unsafe</code> block
is suspect when debugging a memory problem: keep <code>unsafe</code> blocks small and
you’ll thank yourself later since you’ll have less code to investigate.</p>
<p>In order to isolate unsafe code as much as possible, it’s a good idea to
enclose unsafe code within a safe abstraction and provide a safe API, which
we’ll be discussing once we get into unsafe functions and methods. Parts of the
standard library are implemented as safe abstractions over unsafe code that has
been audited. This prevents uses of <code>unsafe</code> from leaking out into all the
places that you or your users might want to make use of the functionality
implemented with <code>unsafe</code> code, since using a safe abstraction is safe.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about each of the four unsafe superpowers in turn, and along the way
we’ll look at some abstractions that provide a safe interface to unsafe code.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dereferencing-a-raw-pointer" id="dereferencing-a-raw-pointer"><h3>Dereferencing a Raw Pointer</h3></a>
<p>Way back in Chapter 4, we first learned about references. We also learned that
the compiler ensures that references are always valid. Unsafe Rust has two new
types similar to references called <em>raw pointers</em>. Just like references, we can
have an immutable raw pointer and a mutable raw pointer, written as <code>*const T</code>
and <code>*mut T</code>, respectively. In the context of raw pointers, “immutable” means
that the pointer can’t be directly assigned to after being dereferenced.</p>
<p>Raw pointers are different than references and smart pointers in a few ways.
Raw pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are allowed to ignore the borrowing rules and have both immutable and a
mutable pointer or multiple mutable pointers to the same location</li>
<li>Aren’t guaranteed to point to valid memory</li>
<li>Are allowed to be null</li>
<li>Don’t implement any automatic clean-up</li>
</ul>
<p>Listing 19-1 shows how to create raw pointers from references:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut num = 5;

let r1 = &amp;num as *const i32;
let r2 = &amp;mut num as *mut i32;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-1: Creating raw pointers from references</span></p>
<p>The <code>*const T</code> type is an immutable raw pointer, and <code>*mut T</code> is a mutable raw
pointer. We’ve created raw pointers by using <code>as</code> to cast an immutable and a
mutable reference into their corresponding raw pointer types. These particular
raw pointers will be valid since we created them directly from references that
are guaranteed to be valid, but we can’t make that assumption about any raw
pointer.</p>
<p>Listing 19-2 shows how to create a raw pointer to an arbitrary location in
memory. Trying to use arbitrary memory is undefined: there may be data at that
address, there may not be any data at that address, the compiler might optimize
the code so that there is no memory access, or your program might segfault.
There’s not usually a good reason to be writing code like this, but it is
possible:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let address = 0x012345usize;
let r = address as *const i32;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-2: Creating a raw pointer to an arbitrary
memory address</span></p>
<p>Note there’s no <code>unsafe</code> block in either Listing 19-1 or 19-2. You can <em>create</em>
raw pointers in safe code, but you can’t <em>dereference</em> raw pointers and read
the data being pointed to. Using the dereference operator, <code>*</code>, on a raw
pointer requires an <code>unsafe</code> block, as shown in Listing 19-3:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut num = 5;

let r1 = &amp;num as *const i32;
let r2 = &amp;mut num as *mut i32;

unsafe {
    println!(&quot;r1 is: {}&quot;, *r1);
    println!(&quot;r2 is: {}&quot;, *r2);
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-3: Dereferencing raw pointers within an
<code>unsafe</code> block</span></p>
<p>Creating a pointer can’t do any harm; it’s only when accessing the value that
it points at that you might end up dealing with an invalid value.</p>
<p>Note also that in Listing 19-1 and 19-3 we created a <code>*const i32</code> and a <code>*mut i32</code> that both pointed to the same memory location, that of <code>num</code>. If we had
tried to create an immutable and a mutable reference to <code>num</code> instead of raw
pointers, this would not have compiled due to the rule that says we can’t have
a mutable reference at the same time as any immutable references. With raw
pointers, we are able to create a mutable pointer and an immutable pointer to
the same location, and change data through the mutable pointer, potentially
creating a data race. Be careful!</p>
<p>With all of these dangers, why would we ever use raw pointers? One major use
case is interfacing with C code, as we’ll see in the next section on unsafe
functions. Another case is to build up safe abstractions that the borrow
checker doesn’t understand. Let’s introduce unsafe functions then look at an
example of a safe abstraction that uses unsafe code.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#calling-an-unsafe-function-or-method" id="calling-an-unsafe-function-or-method"><h3>Calling an Unsafe Function or Method</h3></a>
<p>The second operation that requires an unsafe block is calling an unsafe
function. Unsafe functions and methods look exactly like regular functions and
methods, but they have an extra <code>unsafe</code> out front. Bodies of unsafe functions
are effectively <code>unsafe</code> blocks. Here’s an unsafe function named <code>dangerous</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
unsafe fn dangerous() {}

unsafe {
    dangerous();
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>If we try to call <code>dangerous</code> without the <code>unsafe</code> block, we’ll get an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0133]: call to unsafe function requires unsafe function or block
 --&gt; &lt;anon&gt;:4:5
  |
4 |     dangerous();
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ call to unsafe function
</code></pre>
<p>By inserting the <code>unsafe</code> block around our call to <code>dangerous</code>, we’re asserting
to Rust that we’ve read the documentation for this function, we understand how
to use it properly, and we’ve verified that everything is correct.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#creating-a-safe-abstraction-over-unsafe-code" id="creating-a-safe-abstraction-over-unsafe-code"><h4>Creating a Safe Abstraction Over Unsafe Code</h4></a>
<p>As an example, let’s check out some functionality from the standard library,
<code>split_at_mut</code>, and explore how we might implement it ourselves. This safe
method is defined on mutable slices, and it takes one slice and makes it into
two by splitting the slice at the index given as an argument, as demonstrated
in Listing 19-4:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

let r = &amp;mut v[..];

let (a, b) = r.split_at_mut(3);

assert_eq!(a, &amp;mut [1, 2, 3]);
assert_eq!(b, &amp;mut [4, 5, 6]);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-4: Using the safe <code>split_at_mut</code>
function</span></p>
<p>This function can’t be implemented using only safe Rust. An attempt might look
like Listing 19-5. For simplicity, we’re implementing <code>split_at_mut</code> as a
function rather than a method, and only for slices of <code>i32</code> values rather than
for a generic type <code>T</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn split_at_mut(slice: &amp;mut [i32], mid: usize) -&gt; (&amp;mut [i32], &amp;mut [i32]) {
    let len = slice.len();

    assert!(mid &lt;= len);

    (&amp;mut slice[..mid],
     &amp;mut slice[mid..])
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-5: An attempted implementation of
<code>split_at_mut</code> using only safe Rust</span></p>
<p>This function first gets the total length of the slice, then asserts that the
index given as a parameter is within the slice by checking that the parameter
is less than or equal to the length. The assertion means that if we pass an
index that’s greater than the length of the slice to split at, the function
will panic before it attempts to use that index.</p>
<p>Then we return two mutable slices in a tuple: one from the start of the initial
slice to the <code>mid</code> index, and another from <code>mid</code> to the end of the slice.</p>
<p>If we try to compile this, we’ll get an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0499]: cannot borrow `*slice` as mutable more than once at a time
 --&gt; &lt;anon&gt;:6:11

  |           ----- first mutable borrow occurs here
6 |      &amp;mut slice[mid..])
  |           ^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
7 | }
  | - first borrow ends here
</code></pre>
<p>Rust’s borrow checker can’t understand that we’re borrowing different parts of
the slice; it only knows that we’re borrowing from the same slice twice.
Borrowing different parts of a slice is fundamentally okay; our two <code>&amp;mut [i32]</code> slices aren’t overlapping. However, Rust isn’t smart enough to know
this. When we know something is okay, but Rust doesn’t, it’s time to reach for
unsafe code.</p>
<p>Listing 19-6 shows how to use an <code>unsafe</code> block, a raw pointer, and some calls
to unsafe functions to make the implementation of <code>split_at_mut</code> work:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::slice;

fn split_at_mut(slice: &amp;mut [i32], mid: usize) -&gt; (&amp;mut [i32], &amp;mut [i32]) {
    let len = slice.len();
    let ptr = slice.as_mut_ptr();

    assert!(mid &lt;= len);

    unsafe {
        (slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr, mid),
         slice::from_raw_parts_mut(ptr.offset(mid as isize), len - mid))
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-6: Using unsafe code in the implementation of
the <code>split_at_mut</code> function</span></p>
<p>Recall from Chapter 4 that slices are a pointer to some data and the length of
the slice. We’ve often used the <code>len</code> method to get the length of a slice; we
can use the <code>as_mut_ptr</code> method to get access to the raw pointer of a slice. In
this case, since we have a mutable slice to <code>i32</code> values, <code>as_mut_ptr</code> returns
a raw pointer with the type <code>*mut i32</code>, which we’ve stored in the variable
<code>ptr</code>.</p>
<p>The assertion that the <code>mid</code> index is within the slice stays the same. Then,
the <code>slice::from_raw_parts_mut</code> function does the reverse from the <code>as_mut_ptr</code>
and <code>len</code> methods: it takes a raw pointer and a length and creates a slice. We
call <code>slice::from_raw_parts_mut</code> to create a slice that starts from <code>ptr</code> and is
<code>mid</code> items long. Then we call the <code>offset</code> method on <code>ptr</code> with <code>mid</code> as an
argument to get a raw pointer that starts at <code>mid</code>, and we create a slice using
that pointer and the remaining number of items after <code>mid</code> as the length.</p>
<p>Because slices are checked, they’re safe to use once we’ve created them. The
function <code>slice::from_raw_parts_mut</code> is an unsafe function because it takes a
raw pointer and trusts that this pointer is valid. The <code>offset</code> method on raw
pointers is also unsafe, since it trusts that the location some offset after a
raw pointer is also a valid pointer. We’ve put an <code>unsafe</code> block around our
calls to <code>slice::from_raw_parts_mut</code> and <code>offset</code> to be allowed to call them,
and we can tell by looking at the code and by adding the assertion that <code>mid</code>
must be less than or equal to <code>len</code> that all the raw pointers used within the
<code>unsafe</code> block will be valid pointers to data within the slice. This is an
acceptable and appropriate use of <code>unsafe</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the resulting <code>split_at_mut</code> function is safe: we didn’t have to add
the <code>unsafe</code> keyword in front of it, and we can call this function from safe
Rust. We’ve created a safe abstraction to the unsafe code by writing an

creating valid pointers from the data this function has access to.</p>
<p>In contrast, the use of <code>slice::from_raw_parts_mut</code> in Listing 19-7 would
likely crash when the slice is used. This code takes an arbitrary memory
location and creates a slice ten thousand items long:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-7: Creating a slice from an arbitrary memory

<p>We don’t own the memory at this arbitrary location, and there’s no guarantee

<p>Sometimes, your Rust code may need to interact with code written in another
language. To do this, Rust has a keyword, <code>extern</code>, that facilitates creating
and using a <em>Foreign Function Interface</em> (FFI). Listing 19-8 demonstrates how
to set up an integration with the <code>abs</code> function defined in the C standard
library. Functions declared within <code>extern</code> blocks are always unsafe to call
from Rust code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">extern &quot;C&quot; {
    fn abs(input: i32) -&gt; i32;
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        println!(&quot;Absolute value of -3 according to C: {}&quot;, abs(-3));
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-8: Declaring and calling an <code>extern</code> function
defined in another language</span></p>
<p>Within the <code>extern &quot;C&quot;</code> block, we list the names and signatures of functions
defined in a library written in another language that we want to be able to
call.<code>&quot;C&quot;</code> defines which <em>application binary interface</em> (ABI) the external
function uses. The ABI defines how to call the function at the assembly level.
The <code>&quot;C&quot;</code> ABI is the most common, and follows the C programming language’s ABI.</p>
<p>Calling an external function is always unsafe. If we’re calling into some other
language, that language does not enforce Rust’s safety guarantees. Since Rust
can’t check that the external code is safe, we are responsible for checking the
safety of the external code and indicating we have done so by using an <code>unsafe</code>
block to call external functions.</p>

<a class="header" href="print.html#calling-rust-functions-from-other-languages" id="calling-rust-functions-from-other-languages"><h5>Calling Rust Functions from Other Languages</h5></a>
<p>The <code>extern</code> keyword is also used for creating an interface that allows other
languages to call Rust functions. Instead of an <code>extern</code> block, we can add the
<code>extern</code> keyword and specifying the ABI to use just before the <code>fn</code> keyword. We
also add the <code>#[no_mangle]</code> annotation to tell the Rust compiler not to mangle
the name of this function. The <code>call_from_c</code> function in this example would be
accessible from C code, once we’ve compiled to a shared library and linked from
C:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]

<a class="header" href="print.html#accessing-or-modifying-a-mutable-static-variable" id="accessing-or-modifying-a-mutable-static-variable"><h3>Accessing or Modifying a Mutable Static Variable</h3></a>
<p>We’ve gone this entire book without talking about <em>global variables</em>. Many
programming languages support them, and so does Rust. However, global variables
can be problematic: for example, if you have two threads accessing the same
mutable global variable, a data race can happen.</p>
<p>Global variables are called <em>static</em> in Rust. Listing 19-9 shows an example
declaration and use of a static variable with a string slice as a value:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">static HELLO_WORLD: &amp;str = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;name is: {}&quot;, HELLO_WORLD);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-9: Defining and using an immutable static
variable</span></p>
<p><code>static</code> variables are similar to constants: their names are also in
<code>SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE</code> by convention, and we <em>must</em> annotate the variable’s
type, which is <code>&amp;'static str</code> in this case. Only references with the <code>'static</code>
lifetime may be stored in a static variable. Because of this, the Rust compiler
can figure out the lifetime by itself and we don’t need to annotate it
explicitly.</p>
<p>Accessing immutable static variables is safe. Values in a static variable have a
fixed address in memory, and using the value will always access the same data.
Constants, on the other hand, are allowed to duplicate their data whenever they
are used.</p>
<p>Another way in which static variables are different from constants is that
static variables can be mutable. Both accessing and modifying mutable static
variables is unsafe. Listing 19-10 shows how to declare, access, and modify a
mutable static variable named <code>COUNTER</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">static mut COUNTER: u32 = 0;

fn add_to_count(inc: u32) {
    unsafe {
        COUNTER += inc;
    }
}

fn main() {
    add_to_count(3);

    unsafe {
        println!(&quot;COUNTER: {}&quot;, COUNTER);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-10: Reading from or writing to a mutable
static variable is unsafe</span></p>
<p>Just like with regular variables, we specify that a static variable should be
mutable using the <code>mut</code> keyword. Any time that we read or write from <code>COUNTER</code>
has to be within an <code>unsafe</code> block. This code compiles and prints <code>COUNTER: 3</code>
as we would expect since it’s single threaded, but having multiple threads
accessing <code>COUNTER</code> would likely result in data races.</p>
<p>Mutable data that is globally accessible is difficult to manage and ensure that
there are no data races, which is why Rust considers mutable static variables
to be unsafe. If possible, prefer using the concurrency techniques and
threadsafe smart pointers we discussed in Chapter 16 to have the compiler check
that data accessed from different threads is done safely.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#implementing-an-unsafe-trait" id="implementing-an-unsafe-trait"><h3>Implementing an Unsafe Trait</h3></a>
<p>Finally, the last action we’re only allowed to take when we use the <code>unsafe</code>
keyword is implementing an unsafe trait. We can declare that a trait is
<code>unsafe</code> by adding the <code>unsafe</code> keyword before <code>trait</code>, and then implementing
the trait must be marked as <code>unsafe</code> too, as shown in Listing 19-11:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
unsafe trait Foo {
    // methods go here
}

unsafe impl Foo for i32 {
    // method implementations go here
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-11: Defining and implementing an unsafe
trait</span></p>
<p>Like unsafe functions, methods in an unsafe trait have some invariant that the
compiler cannot verify. By using <code>unsafe impl</code>, we’re promising that we’ll
uphold these invariants.</p>
<p>As an example, recall the <code>Sync</code> and <code>Send</code> marker traits from Chapter 16, and
that the compiler implements these automatically if our types are composed
entirely of <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> types. If we implement a type that contains
something that’s not <code>Send</code> or <code>Sync</code> such as raw pointers, and we want to mark
our type as <code>Send</code> or <code>Sync</code>, that requires using <code>unsafe</code>. Rust can’t verify
that our type upholds the guarantees that a type can be safely sent across
threads or accessed from multiple threads, so we need to do those checks
ourselves and indicate as such with <code>unsafe</code>.</p>
<p>Using <code>unsafe</code> to take one of these four actions isn’t wrong or frowned upon,
but it is trickier to get <code>unsafe</code> code correct since the compiler isn’t able
to help uphold memory safety. When you have a reason to use <code>unsafe</code> code,
however, it’s possible to do so, and having the explicit <code>unsafe</code> annotation
makes it easier to track down the source of problems if they occur.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#advanced-lifetimes" id="advanced-lifetimes"><h2>Advanced Lifetimes</h2></a>
<p>Back in Chapter 10, we learned how to annotate references with lifetime
parameters to help Rust understand how the lifetimes of different references
relate. We saw how most of the time, Rust will let you elide lifetimes, but
every reference has a lifetime. There are three advanced features of lifetimes
that we haven’t covered though: <em>lifetime subtyping</em>, <em>lifetime bounds</em>, and
<em>trait object lifetimes</em>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#lifetime-subtyping" id="lifetime-subtyping"><h3>Lifetime Subtyping</h3></a>
<p>Imagine that we want to write a parser. To do this, we’ll have a structure that
holds a reference to the string that we’re parsing, and we’ll call that struct
<code>Context</code>. We’ll write a parser that will parse this string and return success
or failure. The parser will need to borrow the context to do the parsing.
Implementing this would look like the code in Listing 19-12, which won’t
compile because we’ve left off the lifetime annotations for now:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Context(&amp;str);

struct Parser {
    context: &amp;Context,
}

impl Parser {
    fn parse(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), &amp;str&gt; {
        Err(&amp;self.context.0[1..])
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-12: Defining a <code>Context</code> struct that holds a
string slice, a <code>Parser</code> struct that holds a reference to a <code>Context</code> instance,
and a <code>parse</code> method that always returns an error referencing the string
slice</span></p>
<p>For simplicity’s sake, our <code>parse</code> function returns a <code>Result&lt;(), &amp;str&gt;</code>. That
is, we don’t do anything on success, and on failure we return the part of the
string slice that didn’t parse correctly. A real implementation would have more
error information than that, and would actually return something created when
parsing succeeds, but we’re leaving those parts of the implementation off since
they aren’t relevant to the lifetimes part of this example. We’re also defining
<code>parse</code> to always produce an error after the first byte. Note that this may
panic if the first byte is not on a valid character boundary; again, we’re
simplifying the example in order to concentrate on the lifetimes involved.</p>
<p>So how do we fill in the lifetime parameters for the string slice in <code>Context</code>
and the reference to the <code>Context</code> in <code>Parser</code>? The most straightforward thing
to do is to use the same lifetime everywhere, as shown in Listing 19-13:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
struct Context&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a str);

struct Parser&lt;'a&gt; {
    context: &amp;'a Context&lt;'a&gt;,
}

impl&lt;'a&gt; Parser&lt;'a&gt; {
    fn parse(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), &amp;str&gt; {
        Err(&amp;self.context.0[1..])
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-13: Annotating all references in <code>Context</code> and
<code>Parser</code> with the same lifetime parameter</span></p>
<p>This compiles fine. Next, in Listing 19-14, let’s write a function that takes
an instance of <code>Context</code>, uses a <code>Parser</code> to parse that context, and returns
what <code>parse</code> returns. This won’t quite work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn parse_context(context: Context) -&gt; Result&lt;(), &amp;str&gt; {

</code></pre>
<p>These errors are saying that both the <code>Parser</code> instance we’re creating and the
<code>context</code> parameter live from the line that the <code>Parser</code> is created until the
end of the <code>parse_context</code> function, but they both need to live for the entire
lifetime of the function.</p>
<p>In other words, <code>Parser</code> and <code>context</code> need to <em>outlive</em> the entire function
and be valid before the function starts as well as after it ends in order for
all the references in this code to always be valid. Both the <code>Parser</code> we’re
creating and the <code>context</code> parameter go out of scope at the end of the
function, though (since <code>parse_context</code> takes ownership of <code>context</code>).</p>
<p>Let’s look at the definitions in Listing 19-13 again, especially the signature
of the <code>parse</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    fn parse(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), &amp;str&gt; {
</code></pre>
<p>Remember the elision rules? If we annotate the lifetimes of the references, the
signature would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    fn parse&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), &amp;'a str&gt; {
</code></pre>
<p>That is, the error part of the return value of <code>parse</code> has a lifetime that is
tied to the <code>Parser</code> instance’s lifetime (that of <code>&amp;self</code> in the <code>parse</code> method
signature). That makes sense, as the returned string slice references the
string slice in the <code>Context</code> instance that the <code>Parser</code> holds, and we’ve
specified in the definition of the <code>Parser</code> struct that the lifetime of the
reference to <code>Context</code> that <code>Parser</code> holds and the lifetime of the string slice
that <code>Context</code> holds should be the same.</p>
<p>The problem is that the <code>parse_context</code> function returns the value returned
from <code>parse</code>, so the lifetime of the return value of <code>parse_context</code> is tied to
the lifetime of the <code>Parser</code> as well. But the <code>Parser</code> instance created in the
<code>parse_context</code> function won’t live past the end of the function (it’s
temporary), and the <code>context</code> will go out of scope at the end of the function
(<code>parse_context</code> takes ownership of it).</p>
<p>We’re not allowed to return a reference to a value that goes out of scope at
the end of the function. Rust thinks that’s what we’re trying to do because we
annotated all the lifetimes with the same lifetime parameter. That told Rust
the lifetime of the string slice that <code>Context</code> holds is the same as that of
the lifetime of the reference to <code>Context</code> that <code>Parser</code> holds.</p>
<p>The <code>parse_context</code> function can’t see that within the <code>parse</code> function, the
string slice returned will outlive both <code>Context</code> and <code>Parser</code>, and that the
reference <code>parse_context</code> returns refers to the string slice, not to <code>Context</code>
or <code>Parser</code>.</p>
<p>By knowing what the implementation of <code>parse</code> does, we know that the only
reason that the return value of <code>parse</code> is tied to the <code>Parser</code> is because it’s
referencing the <code>Parser</code>’s <code>Context</code>, which is referencing the string slice, so
it’s really the lifetime of the string slice that <code>parse_context</code> needs to care
about. We need a way to tell Rust that the string slice in <code>Context</code> and the
reference to the <code>Context</code> in <code>Parser</code> have different lifetimes and that the
return value of <code>parse_context</code> is tied to the lifetime of the string slice in
<code>Context</code>.</p>
<p>We could try only giving <code>Parser</code> and <code>Context</code> different lifetime parameters
as shown in Listing 19-15. We’ve chosen the lifetime parameter names <code>'s</code> and
<code>'c</code> here to be clearer about which lifetime goes with the string slice in
<code>Context</code> and which goes with the reference to <code>Context</code> in <code>Parser</code>. Note that
this won’t completely fix the problem, but it’s a start and we’ll look at why
this isn’t sufficient when we try to compile.</p>

<p>Rust doesn’t know of any relationship between <code>'c</code> and <code>'s</code>. In order to be
valid, the referenced data in <code>Context</code> with lifetime <code>'s</code> needs to be
constrained to guarantee that it lives longer than the reference to <code>Context</code>
that has lifetime <code>'c</code>. If <code>'s</code> is not longer than <code>'c</code>, then the reference to
<code>Context</code> might not be valid.</p>
<p>Which gets us to the point of this section: Rust has a feature called <em>lifetime
subtyping</em>, which is a way to specify that one lifetime parameter lives at
least as long as another one. In the angle brackets where we declare lifetime
parameters, we can declare a lifetime <code>'a</code> as usual, and declare a lifetime
<code>'b</code> that lives at least as long as <code>'a</code> by declaring <code>'b</code> with the syntax <code>'b: 'a</code>.</p>
<p>In our definition of <code>Parser</code>, in order to say that <code>'s</code> (the lifetime of the
string slice) is guaranteed to live at least as long as <code>'c</code> (the lifetime of
the reference to <code>Context</code>), we change the lifetime declarations to look like
this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# struct Context&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a str);
#
struct Parser&lt;'c, 's: 'c&gt; {
    context: &amp;'c Context&lt;'s&gt;,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Now, the reference to <code>Context</code> in the <code>Parser</code> and the reference to the string
slice in the <code>Context</code> have different lifetimes, and we’ve ensured that the
lifetime of the string slice is longer than the reference to the <code>Context</code>.</p>
<p>That was a very long-winded example, but as we mentioned at the start of this
chapter, these features are pretty niche. You won’t often need this syntax, but
it can come up in situations like this one, where you need to refer to
something you have a reference to.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#lifetime-bounds" id="lifetime-bounds"><h3>Lifetime Bounds</h3></a>
<p>In Chapter 10, we discussed how to use trait bounds on generic types. We can
also add lifetime parameters as constraints on generic types, which are called
<em>lifetime bounds</em>. For example, consider a type that is a wrapper over
references. Recall the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type from Chapter 15: its <code>borrow</code> and
<code>borrow_mut</code> methods return the types <code>Ref</code> and <code>RefMut</code>, respectively. These
types are wrappers over references that keep track of the borrowing rules at
runtime. The definition of the <code>Ref</code> struct is shown in Listing 19-16, without
lifetime bounds for now:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Ref&lt;'a, T&gt;(&amp;'a T);
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-16: Defining a struct to wrap a reference to a
generic type; without lifetime bounds to start</span></p>
<p>Without constraining the lifetime <code>'a</code> in relation to the generic parameter
<code>T</code>, we get an error because Rust doesn’t know how long the generic type <code>T</code>
will live:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0309]: the parameter type `T` may not live long enough

  |                   ^^^^^^
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>T</code> can be any type, <code>T</code> could itself be a reference or a type that holds
one or more references, each of which could have their own lifetimes. Rust
can’t be sure <code>T</code> will live as long as <code>'a</code>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Rust gave us helpful advice on how to specify the lifetime bound in
this case:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">consider adding an explicit lifetime bound `T: 'a` so that the reference type
`&amp;'a T` does not outlive the data it points at.
</code></pre>
<p>Listing 19-17 shows how to apply this advice by specifying the lifetime bound
when we declare the generic type <code>T</code>. This code now compiles because the <code>T: 'a</code> syntax specifies that <code>T</code> can be any type, but if it contains any
references, the references must live at least as long as <code>'a</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">

<p>We could choose to solve this in a different way, shown in the definition of a
<code>StaticRef</code> struct in Listing 19-18, by adding the <code>'static</code> lifetime bound on
<code>T</code>. This means if <code>T</code> contains any references, they must have the <code>'static</code>
lifetime:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">

<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-18: Adding a <code>'static</code> lifetime bound to <code>T</code>

<p>Types without any references count as <code>T: 'static</code>. Because <code>'static</code> means the
reference must live as long as the entire program, a type that contains no
references meets the criteria of all references living as long as the entire
program (since there are no references). Think of it this way: if the borrow
checker is concerned about references living long enough, then there’s no real
distinction between a type that has no references and a type that has
references that live forever; both of them are the same for the purpose of
determining whether or not a reference has a shorter lifetime than what it
refers to.</p>

what happens if the type implementing the trait used in the trait object has a

<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-19: Using a type that has a lifetime parameter
with a trait object</span></p>
<p>This code compiles without any errors, even though we haven’t said anything
about the lifetimes involved in <code>obj</code>. This works because there are rules
having to do with lifetimes and trait objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The default lifetime of a trait object is <code>'static</code>.</li>
<li>If we have <code>&amp;'a X</code> or <code>&amp;'a mut X</code>, then the default is <code>'a</code>.</li>
<li>If we have a single <code>T: 'a</code> clause, then the default is <code>'a</code>.</li>
<li>If we have multiple <code>T: 'a</code>-like clauses, then there is no default; we must
be explicit.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we must be explicit, we can add a lifetime bound on a trait object like
<code>Box&lt;Foo&gt;</code> with the syntax <code>Box&lt;Foo + 'a&gt;</code> or <code>Box&lt;Foo + 'static&gt;</code>, depending
on what’s needed. Just as with the other bounds, this means that any
implementor of the <code>Foo</code> trait that has any references inside must have the
lifetime specified in the trait object bounds as those references.</p>
<p>Next, let’s take a look at some other advanced features dealing with traits!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#advanced-traits" id="advanced-traits"><h2>Advanced Traits</h2></a>
<p>We covered traits in Chapter 10, but like lifetimes, we didn’t get to all the
details. Now that we know more Rust, we can get into the nitty-gritty.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#associated-types" id="associated-types"><h3>Associated Types</h3></a>
<p><em>Associated types</em> are a way of associating a type placeholder with a trait
such that the trait method definitions can use these placeholder types in their
signatures. The implementor of a trait will specify the concrete type to be
used in this type’s place for the particular implementation.</p>
<p>We’ve described most of the things in this chapter as being very rare.
Associated types are somewhere in the middle; they’re more rare than the rest
of the book, but more common than many of the things in this chapter.</p>
<p>An example of a trait with an associated type is the <code>Iterator</code> trait provided
by the standard library. It has an associated type named <code>Item</code> that stands in
for the type of the values that we’re iterating over. We mentioned in Chapter
13 that the definition of the <code>Iterator</code> trait is as shown in Listing 19-20:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;
    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;;
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-20: The definition of the <code>Iterator</code> trait
that has an associated type <code>Item</code></span></p>
<p>This says that the <code>Iterator</code> trait has an associated type named <code>Item</code>. <code>Item</code>
is a placeholder type, and the return value of the <code>next</code> method will return
values of type <code>Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;</code>. Implementors of this trait will specify
the concrete type for <code>Item</code>, and the <code>next</code> method will return an <code>Option</code>
containing a value of whatever type the implementor has specified.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#associated-types-versus-generics" id="associated-types-versus-generics"><h4>Associated Types Versus Generics</h4></a>
<p>When we implemented the <code>Iterator</code> trait on the <code>Counter</code> struct in Listing
13-6, we specified that the <code>Item</code> type was <code>u32</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl Iterator for Counter {
    type Item = u32;

    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt; {
</code></pre>
<p>This feels similar to generics. So why isn’t the <code>Iterator</code> trait defined as
shown in Listing 19-21?</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub trait Iterator&lt;T&gt; {
    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;T&gt;;
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-21: A hypothetical definition of the
<code>Iterator</code> trait using generics</span></p>
<p>The difference is that with the definition in Listing 19-21, we could also
implement <code>Iterator&lt;String&gt; for Counter</code>, or any other type as well, so that
we’d have multiple implementations of <code>Iterator</code> for <code>Counter</code>. In other words,
when a trait has a generic parameter, we can implement that trait for a type
multiple times, changing the generic type parameters’ concrete types each time.
Then when we use the <code>next</code> method on <code>Counter</code>, we’d have to provide type
annotations to indicate which implementation of <code>Iterator</code> we wanted to use.</p>
<p>With associated types, we can’t implement a trait on a type multiple times.
Using the actual definition of <code>Iterator</code> from Listing 19-20, we can only
choose once what the type of <code>Item</code> will be, since there can only be one <code>impl Iterator for Counter</code>. We don’t have to specify that we want an iterator of
<code>u32</code> values everywhere that we call <code>next</code> on <code>Counter</code>.</p>
<p>The benefit of not having to specify generic type parameters when a trait uses
associated types shows up in another way as well. Consider the two traits
defined in Listing 19-22. Both are defining a trait having to do with a graph
structure that contains nodes of some type and edges of some type. <code>GGraph</code> is
defined using generics, and <code>AGraph</code> is defined using associated types:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
trait GGraph&lt;Node, Edge&gt; {
    // methods would go here
}

trait AGraph {
    type Node;
    type Edge;

    // methods would go here
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-22: Two graph trait definitions, <code>GGraph</code>
using generics and <code>AGraph</code> using associated types for <code>Node</code> and <code>Edge</code></span></p>
<p>Let’s say we wanted to implement a function that computes the distance between
two nodes in any types that implement the graph trait. With the <code>GGraph</code> trait
defined using generics, our <code>distance</code> function signature would have to look
like Listing 19-23:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# trait GGraph&lt;Node, Edge&gt; {}
#
fn distance&lt;N, E, G: GGraph&lt;N, E&gt;&gt;(graph: &amp;G, start: &amp;N, end: &amp;N) -&gt; u32 {
    // --snip--
#     0
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-23: The signature of a <code>distance</code> function
that uses the trait <code>GGraph</code> and has to specify all the generic
parameters</span></p>
<p>Our function would need to specify the generic type parameters <code>N</code>, <code>E</code>, and
<code>G</code>, where <code>G</code> is bound by the trait <code>GGraph</code> that has type <code>N</code> as its <code>Node</code>
type and type <code>E</code> as its <code>Edge</code> type. Even though <code>distance</code> doesn’t need to
know the types of the edges, we’re forced to declare an <code>E</code> parameter, because
we need to to use the <code>GGraph</code> trait and that requires specifying the type for
<code>Edge</code>.</p>
<p>Contrast with the definition of <code>distance</code> in Listing 19-24 that uses the
<code>AGraph</code> trait from Listing 19-22 with associated types:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# trait AGraph {
#     type Node;
#     type Edge;
# }
#
fn distance&lt;G: AGraph&gt;(graph: &amp;G, start: &amp;G::Node, end: &amp;G::Node) -&gt; u32 {
    // --snip--
#     0
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-24: The signature of a <code>distance</code> function
that uses the trait <code>AGraph</code> and the associated type <code>Node</code></span></p>
<p>This is much cleaner. We only need to have one generic type parameter, <code>G</code>,
with the trait bound <code>AGraph</code>. Since <code>distance</code> doesn’t use the <code>Edge</code> type at
all, it doesn’t need to be specified anywhere. To use the <code>Node</code> type
associated with <code>AGraph</code>, we can specify <code>G::Node</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#trait-objects-with-associated-types" id="trait-objects-with-associated-types"><h4>Trait Objects with Associated Types</h4></a>
<p>You may have been wondering why we didn’t use a trait object in the <code>distance</code>
functions in Listing 19-23 and Listing 19-24. The signature for the <code>distance</code>
function using the generic <code>GGraph</code> trait does get a bit more concise using a
trait object:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# trait GGraph&lt;Node, Edge&gt; {}
#
fn distance&lt;N, E&gt;(graph: &amp;GGraph&lt;N, E&gt;, start: &amp;N, end: &amp;N) -&gt; u32 {
    // --snip--
#     0
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This might be a more fair comparison to Listing 19-24. Specifying the <code>Edge</code>
type is still required, though, which means Listing 19-24 is still preferable
since we don’t have to specify something we don’t use.</p>
<p>It’s not possible to change Listing 19-24 to use a trait object for the graph,
since then there would be no way to refer to the <code>AGraph</code> trait’s associated
type.</p>
<p>It is possible in general to use trait objects of traits that have associated
types, though; Listing 19-25 shows a function named <code>traverse</code> that doesn’t
need to use the trait’s associated types in other arguments. We do, however,
have to specify the concrete types for the associated types in this case. Here,
we’ve chosen to accept types that implement the <code>AGraph</code> trait with the
concrete type of <code>usize</code> as their <code>Node</code> type and a tuple of two <code>usize</code> values
for their <code>Edge</code> type:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# trait AGraph {
#     type Node;
#     type Edge;
# }
#
fn traverse(graph: &amp;AGraph&lt;Node=usize, Edge=(usize, usize)&gt;) {
    // --snip--
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>While trait objects mean that we don’t need to know the concrete type of the
<code>graph</code> parameter at compile time, we do need to constrain the use of the
<code>AGraph</code> trait in the <code>traverse</code> function by the concrete types of the
associated types. If we didn’t provide this constraint, Rust wouldn’t be able
to figure out which <code>impl</code> to match this trait object to.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#operator-overloading-and-default-type-parameters" id="operator-overloading-and-default-type-parameters"><h3>Operator Overloading and Default Type Parameters</h3></a>
<p>The <code>&lt;PlaceholderType=ConcreteType&gt;</code> syntax is used in another way as well: to
specify the default type for a generic type. A great example of a situation
where this is useful is operator overloading.</p>
<p>Rust does not allow you to create your own operators or overload arbitrary
operators, but the operations and corresponding traits listed in <code>std::ops</code> can
be overloaded by implementing the traits associated with the operator. For
example, Listing 19-25 shows how to overload the <code>+</code> operator by implementing
the <code>Add</code> trait on a <code>Point</code> struct so that we can add two <code>Point</code> instances
together:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">use std::ops::Add;

#[derive(Debug,PartialEq)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Add for Point {
    type Output = Point;

    fn add(self, other: Point) -&gt; Point {
        Point {
            x: self.x + other.x,
            y: self.y + other.y,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(Point { x: 1, y: 0 } + Point { x: 2, y: 3 },
               Point { x: 3, y: 3 });
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-25: Implementing the <code>Add</code> trait to overload
the <code>+</code> operator for <code>Point</code> instances</span></p>
<p>We’ve implemented the <code>add</code> method to add the <code>x</code> values of two <code>Point</code>
instances together and the <code>y</code> values of two <code>Point</code> instances together to
create a new <code>Point</code>. The <code>Add</code> trait has an associated type named <code>Output</code>
that’s used to determine the type returned from the <code>add</code> method.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the <code>Add</code> trait in a bit more detail. Here’s its definition:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
trait Add&lt;RHS=Self&gt; {
    type Output;

    fn add(self, rhs: RHS) -&gt; Self::Output;
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This should look familiar; it’s a trait with one method and an associated type.
The new part is the <code>RHS=Self</code> in the angle brackets: this syntax is called
<em>default type parameters</em>. <code>RHS</code> is a generic type parameter (short for “right
hand side”) that’s used for the type of the <code>rhs</code> parameter in the <code>add</code>
method. If we don’t specify a concrete type for <code>RHS</code> when we implement the
<code>Add</code> trait, the type of <code>RHS</code> will default to the type of <code>Self</code> (the type
that we’re implementing <code>Add</code> on).</p>
<p>Let’s look at another example of implementing the <code>Add</code> trait. Imagine we have
two structs holding values in different units, <code>Millimeters</code> and <code>Meters</code>. We
can implement <code>Add</code> for <code>Millimeters</code> in different ways as shown in Listing
19-26:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::ops::Add;

struct Millimeters(u32);
struct Meters(u32);

impl Add for Millimeters {
    type Output = Millimeters;

    fn add(self, other: Millimeters) -&gt; Millimeters {
        Millimeters(self.0 + other.0)
    }
}

impl Add&lt;Meters&gt; for Millimeters {
    type Output = Millimeters;

    fn add(self, other: Meters) -&gt; Millimeters {
        Millimeters(self.0 + (other.0 * 1000))
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-26: Implementing the <code>Add</code> trait on
<code>Millimeters</code> to be able to add <code>Millimeters</code> to <code>Millimeters</code> and
<code>Millimeters</code> to <code>Meters</code></span></p>
<p>If we’re adding <code>Millimeters</code> to other <code>Millimeters</code>, we don’t need to
parameterize the <code>RHS</code> type for <code>Add</code> since the default <code>Self</code> type is what we
want. If we want to implement adding <code>Millimeters</code> and <code>Meters</code>, then we need
to say <code>impl Add&lt;Meters&gt;</code> to set the value of the <code>RHS</code> type parameter.</p>
<p>Default type parameters are used in two main ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>To extend a type without breaking existing code.</li>
<li>To allow customization in a way most users don’t want.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>Add</code> trait is an example of the second purpose: most of the time, you’re
adding two like types together. Using a default type parameter in the <code>Add</code>
trait definition makes it easier to implement the trait since you don’t have to
specify the extra parameter most of the time. In other words, we’ve removed a
little bit of implementation boilerplate.</p>
<p>The first purpose is similar, but in reverse: since existing implementations of
a trait won’t have specified a type parameter, if we want to add a type
parameter to an existing trait, giving it a default will let us extend the
functionality of the trait without breaking the existing implementation code.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#fully-qualified-syntax-for-disambiguation" id="fully-qualified-syntax-for-disambiguation"><h3>Fully Qualified Syntax for Disambiguation</h3></a>
<p>Rust cannot prevent a trait from having a method with the same name as another
trait’s method, nor can it prevent us from implementing both of these traits on
one type. We can also have a method implemented directly on the type with the
same name as well! In order to be able to call each of the methods with the
same name, then, we need to tell Rust which one we want to use.</p>
<p>Consider the code in Listing 19-27 where we’ve defined two traits, <code>Pilot</code> and
<code>Wizard</code>, that both have a method called <code>fly</code>. We then implement both traits
on a type <code>Human</code> that itself already has a method named <code>fly</code> implemented on
it. Each <code>fly</code> method does something different:</p>

<p>In order to call the <code>fly</code> methods from either the <code>Pilot</code> trait or the

<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-29: Specifying which trait’s <code>fly</code> method we
want to call</span></p>
<p>Specifying the trait name before the method name clarifies to Rust which
implementation of <code>fly</code> we want to call. We could also choose to write
<code>Human::fly(&amp;person)</code>, which is equivalent to <code>person.fly()</code> that we had in
Listing 19-28, but is a bit longer to write if we don’t need to disambiguate.</p>
<p>Running this code will print:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Because the <code>fly</code> method takes a <code>self</code> parameter, if we had two <em>types</em> that
both implement one <em>trait</em>, Rust can figure out which implementation of a trait
to use based on the type of <code>self</code>.</p>
<p>However, associated functions that are part of traits don’t have a <code>self</code>
parameter. When two types in the same scope implement that trait, Rust can’t
figure out which type we mean unless we use <em>fully qualified syntax</em>. For
example, take the <code>Animal</code> trait in Listing 19-30 that has the associated
function <code>baby_name</code>, the implementation of <code>Animal</code> for the struct <code>Dog</code>, and
the associated function <code>baby_name</code> defined on <code>Dog</code> directly:</p>

<p>This code is for an animal shelter where they want to give all puppies the name
Spot, which is implemented in the <code>baby_name</code> associated function that is
defined on <code>Dog</code>. The <code>Dog</code> type also implements the trait <code>Animal</code>, which
describes characteristics that all animals have. Baby dogs are called puppies,
and that is expressed in the implementation of the <code>Animal</code> trait on <code>Dog</code> in
the <code>baby_name</code> function associated with the <code>Animal</code> trait.</p>

we’re specifying that we want to call the <code>baby_name</code> method from the <code>Animal</code>
trait as implemented on <code>Dog</code> by saying that we want to treat the <code>Dog</code> type as
an <code>Animal</code> for this function call. This code will now print what we want:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">A baby dog is called a puppy
</code></pre>
<p>In general, fully qualified syntax is defined as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">&lt;Type as Trait&gt;::function(receiver_if_method, next_arg, ...);
</code></pre>
<p>For associated functions, there would not be a <code>receiver</code>, there would only be
the list of other arguments. We could choose to use fully qualified syntax
everywhere that we call functions or methods. However, we’re allowed to leave
out any part of this syntax that Rust is able to figure out from other
information in the program. We only need to use this more verbose syntax in
cases where there are multiple implementations that use the same name and Rust
needs help in order to know which implementation we want to call.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we may want a trait to be able to rely on another trait also being
implemented wherever our trait is implemented, so that our trait can use the
other trait’s functionality. The required trait is a <em>supertrait</em> of the trait
we’re implementing.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we want to make an <code>OutlinePrint</code> trait with an
<code>outline_print</code> method that will print out a value outlined in asterisks. That
is, if our <code>Point</code> struct implements <code>Display</code> to result in <code>(x, y)</code>, calling
<code>outline_print</code> on a <code>Point</code> instance that has 1 for <code>x</code> and 3 for <code>y</code> would
look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">**********
*        *
* (1, 3) *
*        *
**********
</code></pre>
<p>In the implementation of <code>outline_print</code>, since we want to be able to use the
<code>Display</code> trait’s functionality, we need to be able to say that the
<code>OutlinePrint</code> trait will only work for types that also implement <code>Display</code> and
provide the functionality that <code>OutlinePrint</code> needs. We can do that in the
trait definition by specifying <code>OutlinePrint: Display</code>. It’s like adding a
trait bound to the trait. Listing 19-33 shows an implementation of the
<code>OutlinePrint</code> trait:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::fmt;

trait OutlinePrint: fmt::Display {
    fn outline_print(&amp;self) {
        let output = self.to_string();
        let len = output.len();
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, &quot;*&quot;.repeat(len + 4));
        println!(&quot;*{}*&quot;, &quot; &quot;.repeat(len + 2));
        println!(&quot;* {} *&quot;, output);
        println!(&quot;*{}*&quot;, &quot; &quot;.repeat(len + 2));
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, &quot;*&quot;.repeat(len + 4));
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-33: Implementing the <code>OutlinePrint</code> trait that
requires the functionality from <code>Display</code></span></p>
<p>Because we’ve specified that <code>OutlinePrint</code> requires the <code>Display</code> trait, we
can use <code>to_string</code> in <code>outline_print</code> (<code>to_string</code> is automatically
implemented for any type that implements <code>Display</code>). If we hadn’t added the <code>: Display</code> after the trait name and we tried to use <code>to_string</code> in
<code>outline_print</code>, we’d get an error that no method named <code>to_string</code> was found
for the type <code>&amp;Self</code> in the current scope.</p>
<p>If we try to implement <code>OutlinePrint</code> on a type that doesn’t implement
<code>Display</code>, such as the <code>Point</code> struct:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# trait OutlinePrint {}
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl OutlinePrint for Point {}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We’ll get an error that <code>Display</code> isn’t implemented and that <code>Display</code> is
required by <code>OutlinePrint</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0277]: the trait bound `Point: std::fmt::Display` is not satisfied

   `:?` instead if you are using a format string

<p>Once we implement <code>Display</code> on <code>Point</code> and satisfy the constraint that
<code>OutlinePrint</code> requires, like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {

impl fmt::Display for Point {
    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut fmt::Formatter) -&gt; fmt::Result {
        write!(f, &quot;({}, {})&quot;, self.x, self.y)
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>then implementing the <code>OutlinePrint</code> trait on <code>Point</code> will compile successfully
and we can call <code>outline_print</code> on a <code>Point</code> instance to display it within an
outline of asterisks.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-newtype-pattern-to-implement-external-traits-on-external-types" id="the-newtype-pattern-to-implement-external-traits-on-external-types"><h3>The Newtype Pattern to Implement External Traits on External Types</h3></a>
<p>In Chapter 10, we mentioned the orphan rule, which says we’re allowed to
implement a trait on a type as long as either the trait or the type are local
to our crate. One way to get around this restriction is to use the <em>newtype
pattern</em>, which involves creating a new type using a tuple struct with one
field as a thin wrapper around the type we want to implement a trait for. Then
the wrapper type is local to our crate, and we can implement the trait on the
wrapper. “Newtype” is a term originating from the Haskell programming language.
There’s no runtime performance penalty for using this pattern. The wrapper type
is elided at compile time.</p>
<p>For example, if we wanted to implement <code>Display</code> on <code>Vec</code>, we can make a
<code>Wrapper</code> struct that holds an instance of <code>Vec</code>. Then we can implement
<code>Display</code> on <code>Wrapper</code> and use the <code>Vec</code> value as shown in Listing 19-34:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">use std::fmt;

struct Wrapper(Vec&lt;String&gt;);

impl fmt::Display for Wrapper {
    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut fmt::Formatter) -&gt; fmt::Result {
        write!(f, &quot;[{}]&quot;, self.0.join(&quot;, &quot;))
    }
}

fn main() {
    let w = Wrapper(vec![String::from(&quot;hello&quot;), String::from(&quot;world&quot;)]);
    println!(&quot;w = {}&quot;, w);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-34: Creating a <code>Wrapper</code> type around
<code>Vec&lt;String&gt;</code> to be able to implement <code>Display</code></span></p>
<p>The implementation of <code>Display</code> uses <code>self.0</code> to access the inner <code>Vec</code>, and
then we can use the functionality of the <code>Display</code> type on <code>Wrapper</code>.</p>
<p>The downside is that since <code>Wrapper</code> is a new type, it doesn’t have the methods
of the value it’s holding; we’d have to implement all the methods of <code>Vec</code> like
<code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, and all the rest directly on <code>Wrapper</code> to delegate to <code>self.0</code>
in order to be able to treat <code>Wrapper</code> exactly like a <code>Vec</code>. If we wanted the
new type to have every single method that the inner type has, implementing the
<code>Deref</code> trait that we discussed in Chapter 15 on the wrapper to return the
inner type can be a solution. If we don’t want the wrapper type to have all the
methods of the inner type, in order to restrict the wrapper type’s behavior for
example, we’d have to implement just the methods we do want ourselves.</p>
<p>That’s how the newtype pattern is used in relation to traits; it’s also a
useful pattern without having traits involved. Let’s switch focus now to talk
about some advanced ways to interact with Rust’s type system.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#advanced-types" id="advanced-types"><h2>Advanced Types</h2></a>
<p>The Rust type system has some features that we’ve mentioned or used without
discussing. We started talking about the newtype pattern in regards to traits;
we’ll start with a more general discussion about why newtypes are useful as
types. We’ll then move to type aliases, a feature that is similar to newtypes
but has slightly different semantics. We’ll also discuss the <code>!</code> type and
dynamically sized types.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#using-the-newtype-pattern-for-type-safety-and-abstraction" id="using-the-newtype-pattern-for-type-safety-and-abstraction"><h3>Using the Newtype Pattern for Type Safety and Abstraction</h3></a>
<p>The newtype pattern that we started discussing at the end of the “Advanced
Traits” section, where we create a new type as a tuple struct with one field
that wraps a type can also be useful for statically enforcing that values are
never confused, and is often used to indicate the units of a value. We actually
had an example of this in Listing 19-26: the <code>Millimeters</code> and <code>Meters</code> structs
both wrap <code>u32</code> values in a new type. If we write a function with a parameter
of type <code>Millimeters</code>, we won’t be able to compile a program that accidentally
tries to call that function with a value of type <code>Meters</code> or a plain <code>u32</code>.</p>
<p>Another reason to use the newtype pattern is to abstract away some
implementation details of a type: the wrapper type can expose a different
public API than the private inner type would if we used it directly in order to
restrict the functionality that is available, for example. New types can also
hide internal generic types. For example, we could provide a <code>People</code> type that
wraps a <code>HashMap&lt;i32, String&gt;</code> that stores a person’s ID associated with their
name. Code using <code>People</code> would only interact with the public API we provide,
such as a method to add a name string to the <code>People</code> collection, and that code
wouldn’t need to know that we assign an <code>i32</code> ID to names internally. The
newtype pattern is a lightweight way to achieve encapsulation to hide
implementation details that we discussed in Chapter 17.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#type-aliases-create-type-synonyms" id="type-aliases-create-type-synonyms"><h3>Type Aliases Create Type Synonyms</h3></a>
<p>The newtype pattern involves creating a new struct to be a new, separate type.
Rust also provides the ability to declare a <em>type alias</em> with the <code>type</code>
keyword to give an existing type another name. For example, we can create the
alias <code>Kilometers</code> to <code>i32</code> like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
type Kilometers = i32;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This means <code>Kilometers</code> is a <em>synonym</em> for <code>i32</code>; unlike the <code>Millimeters</code> and
<code>Meters</code> types we created in Listing 19-26, <code>Kilometers</code> is not a separate, new
type. Values that have the type <code>Kilometers</code> will be treated exactly the same
as values of type <code>i32</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
type Kilometers = i32;

let x: i32 = 5;
let y: Kilometers = 5;

println!(&quot;x + y = {}&quot;, x + y);
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Since <code>Kilometers</code> is an alias for <code>i32</code>, they’re the same type. We can add
values of type <code>i32</code> and <code>Kilometers</code> together, and we can pass <code>Kilometers</code>
values to functions that take <code>i32</code> parameters. We don’t get the type checking
benefits that we get from the newtype pattern that we discussed in the previous
section.</p>
<p>The main use case for type synonyms is to reduce repetition. For example, we
may have a lengthy type like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">Box&lt;Fn() + Send + 'static&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Writing this out in function signatures and as type annotations all over the
place can be tiresome and error-prone. Imagine having a project full of code
like that in Listing 19-35:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let f: Box&lt;Fn() + Send + 'static&gt; = Box::new(|| println!(&quot;hi&quot;));

fn takes_long_type(f: Box&lt;Fn() + Send + 'static&gt;) {
    // --snip--
}

fn returns_long_type() -&gt; Box&lt;Fn() + Send + 'static&gt; {
    // --snip--
#     Box::new(|| ())
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-35: Using a long type in many places</span></p>
<p>A type alias makes this code more manageable by reducing the amount of
repetition this project has. Here, we’ve introduced an alias named <code>Thunk</code> for
the verbose type, and we can replace all uses of the type with the shorter
<code>Thunk</code> as shown in Listing 19-36:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
type Thunk = Box&lt;Fn() + Send + 'static&gt;;

let f: Thunk = Box::new(|| println!(&quot;hi&quot;));

fn takes_long_type(f: Thunk) {
    // --snip--
}

fn returns_long_type() -&gt; Thunk {
    // --snip--
#     Box::new(|| ())
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-36: Introducing a type alias <code>Thunk</code> to reduce
repetition</span></p>
<p>Much easier to read and write! Choosing a good name for a type alias can help
communicate your intent as well (<em>thunk</em> is a word for code to be evaluated at
a later time, so it’s an appropriate name for a closure that gets stored).</p>
<p>Another common use of type aliases is with the <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> type. Consider
the <code>std::io</code> module in the standard library. I/O operations often return a
<code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>, since their operations may fail to work. There’s a
<code>std::io::Error</code> struct that represents all of the possible I/O errors. Many of
the functions in <code>std::io</code> will be returning <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> where the <code>E</code> is
<code>std::io::Error</code>, such as these functions in the <code>Write</code> trait:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
use std::io::Error;
use std::fmt;

pub trait Write {
    fn write(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;usize, Error&gt;;
    fn flush(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt;;

    fn write_all(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt;;
    fn write_fmt(&amp;mut self, fmt: fmt::Arguments) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt;;
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We’re writing <code>Result&lt;..., Error&gt;</code> a lot. As such, <code>std::io</code> has this type
alias declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">type Result&lt;T&gt; = Result&lt;T, std::io::Error&gt;;
</code></pre>
<p>Because this is in the <code>std::io</code> module, the fully qualified alias that we can
use is <code>std::io::Result&lt;T&gt;</code>; that is, a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> with the <code>E</code> filled in
as <code>std::io::Error</code>. The <code>Write</code> trait function signatures end up looking like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub trait Write {
    fn write(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;usize&gt;;
    fn flush(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;;

    fn write_all(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;;
    fn write_fmt(&amp;mut self, fmt: Arguments) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The type alias helps in two ways: this is easier to write <em>and</em> it gives us a
consistent interface across all of <code>std::io</code>. Because it’s an alias, it is just
another <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>, which means we can use any methods that work on
<code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> with it, and special syntax like <code>?</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-never-type--that-never-returns" id="the-never-type--that-never-returns"><h3>The Never Type, <code>!</code>, that Never Returns</h3></a>
<p>Rust has a special type named <code>!</code>. In type theory lingo, it’s called the <em>empty
type</em>, because it has no values. We prefer to call it the <em>never type</em>. The name
describes what it does: it stands in the place of the return type when a
function will never return. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn bar() -&gt; ! {
    // --snip--
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is read as “the function <code>bar</code> returns never,” and functions that return
never are called <em>diverging functions</em>. We can’t create values of the type <code>!</code>,
so <code>bar</code> can never possibly return. What use is a type you can never create
values for? If you think all the way back to Chapter 2, we had some code that
looked like this, reproduced here in Listing 19-37:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# let guess = &quot;3&quot;;
# loop {
let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
    Ok(num) =&gt; num,
    Err(_) =&gt; continue,
};
# break;
# }
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-37: A <code>match</code> with an arm that ends in
<code>continue</code></span></p>
<p>At the time, we skipped over some details in this code. In Chapter 6, we
learned that <code>match</code> arms must return the same type. This doesn’t work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let guess = match guess.trim().parse()  {
    Ok(_) =&gt; 5,
    Err(_) =&gt; &quot;hello&quot;,
}
</code></pre>
<p>What would the type of <code>guess</code> be here? It’d have to be both an integer and a
string, and Rust requires that <code>guess</code> can only have one type. So what does
<code>continue</code> return? Why are we allowed to return a <code>u32</code> from one arm in Listing
19-37 and have another arm that ends with <code>continue</code>?</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, <code>continue</code> has a value of <code>!</code>. That is, when Rust goes
to compute the type of <code>guess</code>, it looks at both of the match arms. The former
has a value of <code>u32</code>, and the latter has a value of <code>!</code>. Since <code>!</code> can never
have a value, Rust is okay with this, and decides that the type of <code>guess</code> is
<code>u32</code>. The formal way of describing this behavior is that expressions of type
<code>!</code> can be coerced into any other type. We’re allowed to end this <code>match</code> arm
with <code>continue</code> because <code>continue</code> doesn’t actually return a value; it instead
moves control back to the top of the loop, so in the <code>Err</code> case, we never
actually assign a value to <code>guess</code>.</p>
<p>Another use of the never type is <code>panic!</code>. Remember the <code>unwrap</code> function that
we call on <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> values to produce a value or panic? Here’s its
definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;T&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; {
    pub fn unwrap(self) -&gt; T {
        match self {
            Some(val) =&gt; val,
            None =&gt; panic!(&quot;called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value&quot;),
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the same thing happens as in the <code>match</code> in Listing 19-33: we know that
<code>val</code> has the type <code>T</code>, and <code>panic!</code> has the type <code>!</code>, so the result of the
overall <code>match</code> expression is <code>T</code>. This works because <code>panic!</code> doesn’t produce
a value; it ends the program. In the <code>None</code> case, we won’t be returning a value
from <code>unwrap</code>, so this code is valid.</p>
<p>One final expression that has the type <code>!</code> is a <code>loop</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">print!(&quot;forever &quot;);

loop {
    print!(&quot;and ever &quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the loop never ends, so the value of the expression is <code>!</code>. This wouldn’t
be true if we included a <code>break</code>, however, as the loop would terminate when it
gets to the <code>break</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dynamically-sized-types--sized" id="dynamically-sized-types--sized"><h3>Dynamically Sized Types &amp; <code>Sized</code></h3></a>
<p>Because Rust needs to know things like memory layout, there’s a particular
corner of its type system that can be confusing, and that’s the concept of
<em>dynamically sized types</em>. Sometimes referred to as ‘DSTs’ or ‘unsized types’,
these types let us talk about types whose size we can only know at runtime.</p>
<p>Let’s dig into the details of a dynamically sized type that we’ve been using
this whole book: <code>str</code>. That’s right, not <code>&amp;str</code>, but <code>str</code> on its own. <code>str</code>
is a DST; we can’t know how long the string is until runtime. Since we can’t
know that, we can’t create a variable of type <code>str</code>, nor can we take an
argument of type <code>str</code>. Consider this code, which does not work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let s1: str = &quot;Hello there!&quot;;
let s2: str = &quot;How's it going?&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>These two <code>str</code> values would need to have the exact same memory layout, but
they have different lengths: <code>s1</code> needs 12 bytes of storage, and <code>s2</code> needs 15.
This is why it’s not possible to create a variable holding a dynamically sized
type.</p>
<p>So what to do? Well, you already know the answer in this case: the types of
<code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> are <code>&amp;str</code> rather than <code>str</code>. If you think back to Chapter 4, we
said this about <code>&amp;str</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... it’s a reference to an internal position in the String and the number of
elements that it refers to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while a <code>&amp;T</code> is a single value that stores the memory address of where the
<code>T</code> is located, a <code>&amp;str</code> is <em>two</em> values: the address of the <code>str</code> and how long
it is. As such, a <code>&amp;str</code> has a size we can know at compile time: it’s two times
the size of a <code>usize</code> in length. That is, we always know the size of a <code>&amp;str</code>,
no matter how long the string it refers to is. This is the general way in which
dynamically sized types are used in Rust; they have an extra bit of metadata
that stores the size of the dynamic information. This leads us to the golden
rule of dynamically sized types: we must always put values of dynamically sized
types behind a pointer of some kind.</p>
<!-- Note for Carol: `Rc<str>` is only in an accepted RFC right now, check on
its progress and pull this out if it's not going to be stable by Oct -->
<p>While we’ve talked a lot about <code>&amp;str</code>, we can combine <code>str</code> with all kinds of
pointers: <code>Box&lt;str&gt;</code>, for example, or <code>Rc&lt;str&gt;</code>. In fact, you’ve already seen
this before, but with a different dynamically sized type: traits. Every trait
is a dynamically sized type we can refer to by using the name of the trait. In
Chapter 17, we mentioned that in order to use traits as trait objects, we have
to put them behind a pointer like <code>&amp;Trait</code> or <code>Box&lt;Trait&gt;</code> (<code>Rc&lt;Trait&gt;</code> would
work too). Traits being dynamically sized is the reason we have to do that!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-sized-trait" id="the-sized-trait"><h4>The <code>Sized</code> Trait</h4></a>
<!-- If we end up keeping the section on object safety in ch 17, we should add
a back reference here. /Carol -->
<p>To work with DSTs, Rust has a trait that determines if a type’s size is known
at compile time or not, which is <code>Sized</code>. This trait is automatically
implemented for everything the compiler knows the size of at compile time. In
addition, Rust implicitly adds a bound on <code>Sized</code> to every generic function.
That is, a generic function definition like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn generic&lt;T&gt;(t: T) {
    // --snip--
}
</code></pre>
<p>is actually treated as if we had written this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn generic&lt;T: Sized&gt;(t: T) {
    // --snip--
}
</code></pre>
<p>By default, generic functions will only work on types that have a known size at
compile time. There is, however, special syntax you can use to relax this
restriction:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn generic&lt;T: ?Sized&gt;(t: &amp;T) {
    // --snip--
}
</code></pre>
<p>A trait bound on <code>?Sized</code> is the opposite of a trait bound on <code>Sized</code>; that is,
we would read this as “<code>T</code> may or may not be <code>Sized</code>”. This syntax is only
available for <code>Sized</code>, no other traits.</p>
<p>Also note we switched the type of the <code>t</code> parameter from <code>T</code> to <code>&amp;T</code>: since the
type might not be <code>Sized</code>, we need to use it behind some kind of pointer. In
this case, we’ve chosen a reference.</p>
<p>Next let’s talk about functions and closures!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#advanced-functions--closures" id="advanced-functions--closures"><h2>Advanced Functions &amp; Closures</h2></a>
<p>Finally, let’s discuss some advanced features having to do with functions and
closures: function pointers, diverging functions, and returning closures.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#function-pointers" id="function-pointers"><h3>Function pointers</h3></a>
<p>We’ve talked about how to pass closures to functions, but you can pass regular
functions to functions too! Functions coerce to the type <code>fn</code>, with a lower
case ‘f’ not to be confused with the <code>Fn</code> closure trait. <code>fn</code> is called a
<em>function pointer</em>. The syntax for specifying that a parameter is a function
pointer is similar to that of closures, as shown in Listing 19-38:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn add_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    x + 1
}

fn do_twice(f: fn(i32) -&gt; i32, arg: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    f(arg) + f(arg)
}

fn main() {
    let answer = do_twice(add_one, 5);

    println!(&quot;The answer is: {}&quot;, answer);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-38: Using the <code>fn</code> type to accept a function
pointer as an argument</span></p>
<p>This prints <code>The answer is: 12</code>. We specify that the parameter <code>f</code> in
<code>do_twice</code> is an <code>fn</code> that takes one parameter of type <code>i32</code> and returns an
<code>i32</code>. We can then call <code>f</code> in the body of <code>do_twice</code>. In <code>main</code>, we can pass
the function name <code>add_one</code> as the first argument to <code>do_twice</code>.</p>
<p>Unlike closures, <code>fn</code> is a type rather than a trait, so we specify <code>fn</code> as the
parameter type directly rather than declaring a generic type parameter with one
of the <code>Fn</code> traits as a trait bound.</p>
<p>Function pointers implement all three of the closure traits (<code>Fn</code>, <code>FnMut</code>, and
<code>FnOnce</code>), so we can always pass a function pointer as an argument when calling
a function that expects a closure. Prefer to write functions using a generic
type and one of the closure traits, so that your functions can accept either
functions or closures. An example of a case where you’d only want to accept
<code>fn</code> is when interfacing with external code that doesn’t have closures: C
functions can accept functions as arguments, but C doesn’t have closures.</p>
<p>For example, if we wanted to use the <code>map</code> function to turn a vector of numbers
into a vector of strings, we could use a closure:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let list_of_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
let list_of_strings: Vec&lt;String&gt; = list_of_numbers
    .iter()
    .map(|i| i.to_string())
    .collect();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Or we could name a function as the argument to <code>map</code> instead of the closure:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let list_of_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
let list_of_strings: Vec&lt;String&gt; = list_of_numbers
    .iter()
    .map(ToString::to_string)
    .collect();
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that we do have to use the fully qualified syntax that we talked about in
the “Advanced Traits” section because there are multiple functions available
named <code>to_string</code>; here, we’re using the <code>to_string</code> function defined in the
<code>ToString</code> trait, which the standard library has implemented for any type that
implements <code>Display</code>.</p>
<p>Some people prefer this style, some people prefer the closure. They end up
with the same code, so use whichever feels more clear to you.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#returning-closures" id="returning-closures"><h3>Returning Closures</h3></a>
<p>Because closures are represented by traits, returning closures is a little
tricky; we can’t do it directly. In most cases where we may want to return a
trait, we can instead use the concrete type that implements the trait of what
we’re returning as the return value of the function. We can’t do that with
closures, though. They don’t have a concrete type that’s returnable; we’re not
allowed to use the function pointer <code>fn</code> as a return type, for example.</p>
<p>This code that tries to return a closure directly won’t compile:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn returns_closure() -&gt; Fn(i32) -&gt; i32 {
    |x| x + 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>The compiler error is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0277]: the trait bound `std::ops::Fn(i32) -&gt; i32 + 'static:
std::marker::Sized` is not satisfied
 --&gt; &lt;anon&gt;:2:25
  |
2 | fn returns_closure() -&gt; Fn(i32) -&gt; i32 {
  |                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `std::marker::Sized` is
  not implemented for `std::ops::Fn(i32) -&gt; i32 + 'static`
  |
  = note: `std::ops::Fn(i32) -&gt; i32 + 'static` does not have a constant size
  known at compile-time
  = note: the return type of a function must have a statically known size
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Sized</code> trait again! Rust doesn’t know how much space it’ll need to store the
closure. We saw a solution to this in the previous section, though: we can use
a trait object:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn returns_closure() -&gt; Box&lt;Fn(i32) -&gt; i32&gt; {
    Box::new(|x| x + 1)
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>For more about trait objects, refer back to Chapter 18.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#summary-17" id="summary-17"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>Whew! Now we’ve gone over features of Rust that aren’t used very often, but are
available if you need them. We’ve introduced a lot of complex topics so that
when you encounter them in error message suggestions or when reading others’
code, you’ll at least have seen these concepts and syntax once before.</p>
<p>Now, let’s put everything we’ve learned throughout the book into practice with
one more project!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#final-project-building-a-multithreaded-web-server" id="final-project-building-a-multithreaded-web-server"><h1>Final Project: Building a Multithreaded Web Server</h1></a>
<p>It’s been a long journey, but here we are! It’s the end of the book. Parting is
such sweet sorrow. But before we go, let’s build one more project together, to
show off some of the things we learned in these final chapters, as well as
re-cap some of the earlier ones.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’re going to make: a web server that says hello:</p>
<p><img src="img/trpl20-01.png" alt="hello from rust" /></p>
<p>To do this, we will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn a little bit about TCP and HTTP</li>
<li>Listen for TCP connections on a socket</li>
<li>Parse a tiny number of HTTP requests</li>
<li>Create a proper HTTP response</li>
<li>Improve the throughput of our server with a thread pool</li>
</ol>
<p>Before we get started, however, there’s one thing we should mention: if you
were writing this code in production, there are a lot of better ways to write
it. Specifically, there are a number of robust crates on crates.io that provide
much more complete web server and thread pool implementations than we are going
to build.</p>
<p>However, for this chapter, our intention is to learn, not to take the easy
route. Since Rust is a systems programming language, we’re able to choose what
level of abstraction we want to work with. We’re able to go to a lower level
than is possible or practical in other languages if we so choose. So we’ll be
writing a basic HTTP server and thread pool ourselves in order to learn the
general ideas and techniques behind the crates we might use in the future.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a-single-threaded-web-server" id="a-single-threaded-web-server"><h2>A Single Threaded Web Server</h2></a>
<p>First, let’s get a single threaded web server working. We’re going to work with
the raw bytes of TCP and HTTP requests and responses to send HTML from our
server to a web browser. Let’s start with a quick overview of the protocols
involved.</p>
<p>The <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em> (<em>HTTP</em>) that powers the web is built on top
of the <em>Transmission Control Protocol</em> (<em>TCP</em>). We won’t get into the details
too much, but here’s a short overview: TCP is a low-level protocol, and HTTP
builds a higher-level protocol on top of TCP. Both protocols are what’s called a
<em>request-response protocol</em>, that is, there is a <em>client</em> that initiates
requests, and a <em>server</em> that listens to requests and provides a response to
the client. The contents of those requests and responses are defined by the
protocols themselves.</p>
<p>TCP describes the low-level details of how information gets from one server to
another, but doesn’t specify what that information is; it’s just a bunch of
ones and zeroes. HTTP builds on top of TCP by defining what the content of the
requests and responses should be. As such, it’s technically possible to use
HTTP with other protocols, but in the vast majority of cases, HTTP sends its
data over TCP.</p>
<p>So the first thing we need to build for our web server is to be able to listen
to a TCP connection. The standard library has a <code>std::net</code> module that lets us
do this. Let’s make a new project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo new hello --bin
     Created binary (application) `hello` project
$ cd hello
</code></pre>
<p>And put the code in Listing 20-1 in <code>src/main.rs</code> to start. This code will
listen at the address <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code> for incoming TCP streams. When it gets
an incoming stream, it will print <code>Connection established!</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust no_run">use std::net::TcpListener;

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;).unwrap();

    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();

        println!(&quot;Connection established!&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-1: Listening for incoming streams and printing
a message when we receive a stream</span></p>
<p>A <code>TcpListener</code> allows us to listen for TCP connections. We’ve chosen to listen
to the address <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code>. The part before the colon is an IP address
representing our own computer, and <code>8080</code> is the port. We’ve chosen this port
because HTTP is normally accepted on port 80, but connecting to port 80 requires
administrator privileges. Regular users can listen on ports higher than 1024;
8080 is easy to remember since it’s the HTTP port 80 repeated.</p>
<p>The <code>bind</code> function is sort of like <code>new</code> in that it returns a new
<code>TcpListener</code> instance, but <code>bind</code> is a more descriptive name that fits with
the domain terminology. In networking, people will often talk about “binding to
a port”, so the function that the standard library defined to create a new
<code>TcpListener</code> is called <code>bind</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>bind</code> function returns a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>. Binding may fail, for example, if
we had tried to connect to port 80 without being an administrator. Another
example of a case when binding would fail is if we tried to have two programs
listening to the same port, which would happen if we ran two instances of our
program. Since we’re writing a basic server here, we’re not going to worry
about handling these kinds of errors, and <code>unwrap</code> lets us just stop the
program if they happen.</p>
<p>The <code>incoming</code> method on <code>TcpListener</code> returns an iterator that gives us a
sequence of streams (more specifically, streams of type <code>TcpStream</code>). A
<em>stream</em> represents an open connection between the client and the server. A
<em>connection</em> is the name for the full request/response process when a client
connects to the server, the server generates a response, and the server closes
the connection. As such, the <code>TcpStream</code> will let us read from itself to see
what the client sent, and we can write our response to it. So this <code>for</code> loop
will process each connection in turn and produce a series of streams for us to
handle.</p>
<p>For now, handling a stream means calling <code>unwrap</code> to terminate our program if
the stream has any errors, then printing a message. Errors can happen because
we’re not actually iterating over connections, we’re iterating over <em>connection
attempts</em>. The connection might not work for a number of reasons, many of them
operating-system specific. For example, many operating systems have a limit to
the number of simultaneous open connections; new connection attempts will then
produce an error until some of the open connections are closed.</p>
<p>Let’s try this code out! First invoke <code>cargo run</code> in the terminal, then load up
<code>127.0.0.1:8080</code> in a web browser. The browser will show an error message that
will say something similar to “Connection reset”, since we’re not currently
sending any data back. If we look at our terminal, though, we’ll see a bunch of
messages that were printed when the browser connected to the server!</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">     Running `target/debug/hello`
Connection established!
Connection established!
Connection established!
</code></pre>
<p>We got multiple messages printed out for one browser request; these connections
might be the browser making a request for the page and a request for a
<code>favicon.ico</code> icon that appears in the browser tab, or the browser might be
retrying the connection. Our browser is expecting to speak HTTP, but we aren’t
replying with anything, just closing the connection by moving on to the next
loop iteration. When <code>stream</code> goes out of scope and dropped at the end of the
loop, its connection gets closed as part of the <code>drop</code> implementation for
<code>TcpStream</code>. Browsers sometimes deal with closed connections by retrying, since
the problem might be temporary. The important thing is that we’ve successfully
gotten a handle on a TCP connection!</p>
<p>Remember to stop the program with <span class="keystroke">ctrl-C</span> when
you’re done running a particular version of the code, and restart <code>cargo run</code>
after you’ve made each set of code changes in order to be running the newest
code.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#reading-the-request" id="reading-the-request"><h3>Reading the Request</h3></a>
<p>Let’s read in the request from our browser! Since we’re adding more
functionality that has the purpose of handling the connection, let’s start a
new function to have a nice separation of the concerns around setting up the
server and connections versus processing each connection. In this new
<code>handle_connection</code> function, we’ll read data from the <code>stream</code> and print it
out in order to see the data that the browser is sending us. Change the code to
look like Listing 20-2:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust no_run">use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::net::TcpListener;
use std::net::TcpStream;

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;).unwrap();

    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();

        handle_connection(stream);
    }
}

fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let mut buffer = [0; 512];

    stream.read(&amp;mut buffer).unwrap();

    println!(&quot;Request: {}&quot;, String::from_utf8_lossy(&amp;buffer[..]));
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-2: Reading from the <code>TcpStream</code> and printing
out the data</span></p>
<p>We added <code>std::io::prelude</code> to the beginning in order to bring traits into
scope that let us read from and write to the stream. Instead of printing a
message that we got a connection in the <code>for</code> loop in <code>main</code>, we’re calling the
new <code>handle_connection</code> function and passing the <code>stream</code> to it.</p>
<p>In <code>handle_connection</code>, we made the <code>stream</code> parameter mutable with the <code>mut</code>
keyword. As we read from a stream, the <code>TcpStream</code> instance might read more
than what we ask for into a buffer. Internally, it keeps track of what data it
has returned to us. It needs to be <code>mut</code> because of that state changing, so
even though we usually think of “reading” as not needing mutation, in this
case, we do need to use the <code>mut</code> keyword.</p>
<p>Next, we need to actually read from the stream. We do this in two steps: first,
we declare a <code>buffer</code> on the stack to hold the data that we read in. We’ve made
the buffer 512 bytes in size, which is big enough to hold the data of a basic
request. That’s sufficient for our purposes in this chapter. If we wanted to
handle requests of an arbitrary size, managing the buffer would need to be more
complicated, but we’re keeping it simple for now. We then pass the buffer to
<code>stream.read</code>, which will read bytes from the <code>TcpStream</code> and put them in the
buffer.</p>
<p>Then we convert the bytes in the buffer to a string and print out that string.
The <code>String::from_utf8_lossy</code> function takes a <code>&amp;[u8]</code> and produces a <code>String</code>.
The ‘lossy’ part of the name comes from the behavior when this function sees
invalid UTF-8 sequences: it replaces the invalid sequences with �, <code>U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER</code>. You might see the replacement characters for remaining
characters in the buffer that aren’t filled by request data.</p>
<p>Let’s give this a try! Start up the program and make a request in a web browser
again. Note that we’ll still get an error page in the browser, but the output
of our program in the terminal will now look similar to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run
   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.42 secs

������������������������������������
</code></pre>
<p>You’ll probably get slightly different output depending on your browser. You
also might see this request repeated again. Now that we’re printing out the
request data, we can see why we’re getting multiple connections from one
browser request by looking at the path after <code>Request: GET</code>. If the repeated
connections are all requesting <code>/</code>, we know the browser is trying to fetch <code>/</code>
repeatedly since it’s not getting a response from us.</p>
<p>Let’s break down this request data to understand what the browser is asking of
us. HTTP is a text-based protocol, and a request takes this format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Method Request-URI HTTP-Version CRLF
headers CRLF
message-body
</code></pre>
<p>The first line is called the <em>request line</em>, and it holds information about
what the client is requesting. The first part of the request line is a
<em>method</em>, like <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>, that describes how the client is making this
request.</p>
<p>Then comes the request’s <em>URI</em>, which stands for <em>Uniform Resource Identifier</em>.
URIs are almost, but not quite the same as URLs (<em>Uniform Resource Locators</em>),
which is what we typically call the addresses that we enter into a web browser.
The HTTP spec uses the term URI, and the difference between URIs and URLs isn’t
important for our purposes of this chapter, so we can just mentally substitute
URL for URI here.</p>
<p>Next, we have the HTTP version that the client used, and then the request line
ends in a CRLF sequence. The CRLF sequence can also be written as <code>\r\n</code>: <code>\r</code>
is a <em>carriage return</em> and <code>\n</code> is a <em>line feed</em>. These terms come from the
typewriter days! The CRLF sequence separates the request line from the rest of
the request data.</p>
<p>Taking a look at the request line data we saw printed out by our code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">GET / HTTP/1.1
</code></pre>
<p><code>GET</code> is the method, <code>/</code> is the Request URI, and <code>HTTP/1.1</code> is the version.</p>
<p>The remaining lines starting from <code>Host:</code> onward are headers; <code>GET</code> requests
have no body.</p>
<p>Try making a request from a different browser, or asking for a different
address like <code>127.0.0.1:8080/test</code> to see how the request data changes, if
you’d like.</p>
<p>Now that we know what the browser is asking for, let’s send some data back!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#writing-a-response" id="writing-a-response"><h3>Writing a Response</h3></a>
<p>Let’s send data back to our browser in response to its request. Responses have
this format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">HTTP-Version Status-Code Reason-Phrase CRLF
headers CRLF
message-body
</code></pre>
<p>The first line is called a <em>status line</em> and contains the HTTP version used in
the response, a numeric status code that summarizes the result of the request,
and a reason phrase that provides a text description of the status code. After
the CRLF sequence comes any headers, another CRLF sequence, and the body of the
response.</p>
<p>Here’s an example response that uses version 1.1 of HTTP, has a status code of
<code>200</code>, a reason phrase of <code>OK</code>, no headers, and no body:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n
</code></pre>
<p>This text is a tiny successful HTTP response. Let’s write this to the stream!
Remove the <code>println!</code> that was printing the request data, and add the code in
Listing 20-3 in its place:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# use std::io::prelude::*;
# use std::net::TcpStream;
fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let mut buffer = [0; 512];

    stream.read(&amp;mut buffer).unwrap();

    let response = &quot;HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n&quot;;

    stream.write(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
    stream.flush().unwrap();
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-3: Writing a tiny successful HTTP response to
the stream</span></p>
<p>The first new line defines the <code>response</code> variable that holds the data of the
tiny success response we’re sending back. Then, we call <code>as_bytes</code> on our
<code>response</code> because the <code>write</code> method on <code>stream</code> takes a <code>&amp;[u8]</code> and sends
those bytes directly down the connection.</p>
<p>The <code>write</code> operation could fail, so <code>write</code> returns a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>; we’re
continuing to use <code>unwrap</code> to make progress on the core ideas in this chapter
rather than error handling. Finally, <code>flush</code> will wait until all of the bytes
are written to the connection; <code>TcpStream</code> contains an internal buffer to
minimize calls into the underlying operating system.</p>
<p>With these changes, let’s run our code and make a request! We’re no longer
printing any data to the terminal, so we won’t see any output there other than
the output from Cargo. When we load <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code> in a web browser, though,
we get a blank page instead of an error. How exciting! You’ve just hand-coded
an HTTP request and response.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#returning-real-html" id="returning-real-html"><h3>Returning Real HTML</h3></a>
<p>Let’s return more than a blank page. Create a new file, <em>hello.html</em>, in the
root of your project directory, that is, not in the <code>src</code> directory. You can
put any HTML you want in it; Listing 20-4 shows what the authors used for
theirs:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: hello.html</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Hello!&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hi from Rust&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-4: A sample HTML file to return in a
response</span></p>
<p>This is a minimal HTML 5 document with a heading and a little paragraph. Let’s
modify <code>handle_connection</code> as shown in Listing 20-5 to read the HTML file, add
it to the response as a body, and send it:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# use std::io::prelude::*;

fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let mut buffer = [0; 512];
    stream.read(&amp;mut buffer).unwrap();

    let mut file = File::open(&quot;hello.html&quot;).unwrap();

    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&amp;mut contents).unwrap();

    let response = format!(&quot;HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n{}&quot;, contents);

    stream.write(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
    stream.flush().unwrap();
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-5: Sending the contents of <em>hello.html</em> as the
body of the response</span></p>
<p>We’ve added a line at the top to bring the standard library’s <code>File</code> into
scope, and the file opening and reading code should look familiar since we had
similar code in Chapter 12 when we read the contents of a file for our I/O
project in Listing 12-4.</p>
<p>Next, we’re using <code>format!</code> to add the file’s contents as the body of the
success response that we write to the stream.</p>
<p>Run it with <code>cargo run</code>, load up <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code> in your browser, and you
should see your HTML rendered!</p>
<p>Note that we’re currently ignoring the request data in <code>buffer</code> and sending
back the contents of the HTML file unconditionally. Try requesting
<code>127.0.0.1:8080/something-else</code> in your browser and you’ll get back your HTML
for that request too. Sending back the same response for all requests is pretty
limited and not what most web servers do; let’s examine the request and only
send back the HTML file for a well-formed request to <code>/</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#validating-the-request-and-selectively-responding" id="validating-the-request-and-selectively-responding"><h3>Validating the Request and Selectively Responding</h3></a>
<p>Right now, our web server will return the HTML in the file no matter what the
client requested. Let’s check that the browser is requesting <code>/</code>, and instead
return an error if the browser requests anything else. Let’s modify
<code>handle_connection</code> as shown in Listing 20-6, which adds part of the code we’ll
need. This part checks the content of the request we received against what we
know a request for <code>/</code> looks like and adds <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks where we’ll
add code to treat requests differently:</p>

    let mut buffer = [0; 512];
    stream.read(&amp;mut buffer).unwrap();

    let get = b&quot;GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n&quot;;

    if buffer.starts_with(get) {
        let mut file = File::open(&quot;hello.html&quot;).unwrap();

        let mut contents = String::new();
        file.read_to_string(&amp;mut contents).unwrap();

        let response = format!(&quot;HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n{}&quot;, contents);

        stream.write(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();

<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-6: Matching the request against the content we
expect for a request to <code>/</code> and setting up conditionally handling requests to
<code>/</code> differently than other requests</span></p>
<p>Here, we hardcoded the data corresponding to the request that we’re looking for
in the variable <code>get</code>. Because we’re reading raw bytes into the buffer, we use
a byte string, created with <code>b&quot;&quot;</code>, to make <code>get</code> a byte string too. Then, we
check to see if <code>buffer</code> starts with the bytes in <code>get</code>. If it does, we’ve
gotten a well-formed request to <code>/</code>, which is the success case that we want to
handle in the <code>if</code> block. The <code>if</code> block contains the code we added in Listing
20-5 that returns the contents of our HTML file.</p>
<p>If <code>buffer</code> does not start with the bytes in <code>get</code>, we’ve gotten some other
request. We’ll respond to all other requests using the code we’re about to add
in the <code>else</code> block.</p>
<p>If you run this code and request <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code>, you’ll get the HTML that’s
in <em>hello.html</em>. If you make any other request, such as
<code>127.0.0.1:8080/something-else</code>, you’ll get a connection error like we saw when
running the code in Listing 20-1 and Listing 20-2.</p>
<p>Let’s add code to the <code>else</code> block as shown in Listing 20-7 to return a
response with the status code <code>404</code>, which signals that the content for the
request was not found. We’ll also return HTML for a page to render in the
browser indicating as such to the end user:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-8: Sample content for the page to send back

<p>With these changes, try running your server again. Requesting <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code>
should return the contents of <em>hello.html</em>, and any other request, like
<code>127.0.0.1:8080/foo</code>, should return the error HTML from <em>404.html</em>!</p>
<p>There’s a lot of repetition between the code in the <code>if</code> and the <code>else</code> blocks:
they’re both reading files and writing the contents of the files to the stream.
The only differences between the two cases are the status line and the
filename. Let’s pull those differences out into an <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> of one line
each that will assign the values of the status line and the filename to
variables; we can then use those variables unconditionally in the code to read
the file and write the response. The resulting code after this refactoring is
shown in Listing 20-9:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-9: Refactoring so that the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>
blocks only contain the code that differs between the two cases</span></p>
<p>Here, the only thing the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks do is return the appropriate
values for the status line and filename in a tuple; we then use destructuring
to assign these two values to <code>status_line</code> and <code>filename</code> using a pattern in
the <code>let</code> statement like we discussed in Chapter 18.</p>
<p>The duplicated code to read the file and write the response is now outside the
<code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks, and uses the <code>status_line</code> and <code>filename</code> variables.
This makes it easier to see exactly what’s different between the two cases, and
makes it so that we only have one place to update the code if we want to change
how the file reading and response writing works. The behavior of the code in
Listing 20-9 will be exactly the same as that in Listing 20-8.</p>
<p>Awesome! We have a simple little web server in about 40 lines of Rust code that
responds to one request with a page of content and responds to all other
requests with a <code>404</code> response.</p>
<p>Since this server runs in a single thread, though, it can only serve one
request at a time. Let’s see how that can be a problem by simulating some
slow requests.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#how-slow-requests-affect-throughput" id="how-slow-requests-affect-throughput"><h2>How Slow Requests Affect Throughput</h2></a>
<p>Right now, the server will process each request in turn. That works for
services like ours that aren’t expected to get very many requests, but as
applications get more complex, this sort of serial execution isn’t optimal.</p>
<p>Because our current program processes connections sequentially, it won’t
process a second connection until it’s completed processing the first. If we
get one request that takes a long time to process, requests coming in during
that time will have to wait until the long request is finished, even if the new
requests can be processed quickly. Let’s see this in action.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#simulating-a-slow-request-in-the-current-server-implementation" id="simulating-a-slow-request-in-the-current-server-implementation"><h3>Simulating a Slow Request in the Current Server Implementation</h3></a>
<p>Let’s see the effect of a request that takes a long time to process on requests
made to our current server implementation. Listing 20-10 shows the code to
respond to another request, <code>/sleep</code>, that will cause the server to sleep for
five seconds before responding. This will simulate a slow request so that we
can see that our server processes requests serially.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-10: Simulating a slow request by recognizing
<code>/sleep</code> and sleeping for 5 seconds</span></p>
<p>This code is a bit messy, but it’s good enough for our simulation purposes! We
created a second request <code>sleep</code>, whose data we’ll recognize. We added an <code>else if</code> after the <code>if</code> block to check for the request to <code>/sleep</code>, and when we see
that request, we’ll sleep for five seconds before rendering the hello page.</p>
<p>You can really see how primitive our server is here; real libraries would
handle the recognition of multiple requests in a less verbose way!</p>
<p>Start the server with <code>cargo run</code>, and then open up two browser windows: one
for <code>http://localhost:8080/</code> and one for <code>http://localhost:8080/sleep</code>. If
you hit <code>/</code> a few times, as before, you’ll see it respond quickly. But if you
hit <code>/sleep</code>, and then load up <code>/</code>, you’ll see that <code>/</code> waits until <code>sleep</code>
has slept for its full five seconds before going on.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways we could change how our web server works in order to
avoid having all requests back up behind a slow request; the one we’re going to
implement is a thread pool.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#improving-throughput-with-a-thread-pool" id="improving-throughput-with-a-thread-pool"><h3>Improving Throughput with a Thread Pool</h3></a>
<p>A <em>thread pool</em> is a group of spawned threads that are ready to handle some
task. When the program receives a new task, one of the threads in the pool will
be assigned the task and will go off and process it. The remaining threads in
the pool are available to handle any other tasks that come in while the first
thread is processing. When the first thread is done processing its task, it
gets returned to the pool of idle threads ready to handle a new task.</p>
<p>A thread pool will allow us to process connections concurrently: we can start
processing a new connection before an older connection is finished. This
increases the throughput of our server.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’re going to implement: instead of waiting for each request to
process before starting on the next one, we’ll send the processing of each
connection to a different thread. The threads will come from a pool of four
threads that we’ll spawn when we start our program. The reason we’re limiting
the number of threads to a small number is that if we created a new thread for
each request as the requests come in, someone making ten million requests to
our server could create havoc by using up all of our server’s resources and
grinding the processing of all requests to a halt.</p>
<p>Rather than spawning unlimited threads, we’ll have a fixed number of threads
waiting in the pool. As requests come in, we’ll send the requests to the pool
for processing. The pool will maintain a queue of incoming requests. Each of
the threads in the pool will pop a request off of this queue, handle the
request, and then ask the queue for another request. With this design, we can
process <code>N</code> requests concurrently, where <code>N</code> is the number of threads. This
still means that <code>N</code> long-running requests can cause requests to back up in the
queue, but we’ve increased the number of long-running requests we can handle
before that point from one to <code>N</code>.</p>
<p>This design is one of many ways to improve the throughput of our web server.
This isn’t a book about web servers, though, so it’s the one we’re going to
cover. Other options are the fork/join model and the single threaded async I/O
model. If you’re interested in this topic, you may want to read more about
other solutions and try to implement them in Rust; with a low-level language
like Rust, all of these options are possible.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#designing-the-thread-pool-interface" id="designing-the-thread-pool-interface"><h2>Designing the Thread Pool Interface</h2></a>
<p>Let’s talk about what using the pool should look like. The authors often find
that when trying to design some code, writing the client interface first can
really help guide your design. Write the API of the code to be structured in
the way you’d want to call it, then implement the functionality within that
structure rather than implementing the functionality then designing the public
API.</p>
<p>Similar to how we used Test Driven Development in the project in Chapter 12,
we’re going to use Compiler Driven Development here. We’re going to write the
code that calls the functions we wish we had, then we’ll lean on the compiler
to tell us what we should change next. The compiler error messages will guide
our implementation.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#code-structure-if-we-could-use-threadspawn" id="code-structure-if-we-could-use-threadspawn"><h3>Code Structure if We Could Use <code>thread::spawn</code></h3></a>
<p>First, let’s explore what the code to create a new thread for every connection
could look like. This isn’t our final plan due to the problems with potentially
spawning an unlimited number of threads that we talked about earlier, but it’s
a start. Listing 20-11 shows the changes to <code>main</code> to spawn a new thread to
handle each stream within the <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust no_run"># use std::thread;

    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();

        thread::spawn(|| {
            handle_connection(stream);
        });
    }
}
# fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-11: Spawning a new thread for each
stream</span></p>
<p>As we learned in Chapter 16, <code>thread::spawn</code> will create a new thread and then
run the code in the closure in it. If you run this code and load <code>/sleep</code> and
then <code>/</code> in two browser tabs, you’ll indeed see the request to <code>/</code> doesn’t have
to wait for <code>/sleep</code> to finish. But as we mentioned, this will eventually
overwhelm the system since we’re making new threads without any limit.</p>

<p>Go ahead and make the changes in Listing 20-12 to <em>src/main.rs</em>, and let’s use
the compiler errors to drive our development. Here’s the first error we get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo check

error: aborting due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>Great, we need a <code>ThreadPool</code>. Let’s switch the <code>hello</code> crate from a binary
crate to a library crate to hold our <code>ThreadPool</code> implementation, since the
thread pool implementation will be independent of the particular kind of work
that we’re doing in our web server. Once we’ve got the thread pool library
written, we could use that functionality to do whatever work we want to do, not
just serve web requests.</p>
<p>So create <em>src/lib.rs</em> that contains the simplest definition of a <code>ThreadPool</code>
struct that we can have for now:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub struct ThreadPool;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Then create a new directory, <em>src/bin</em>, and move the binary crate rooted in
<em>src/main.rs</em> into <em>src/bin/main.rs</em>. This will make the library crate be the
primary crate in the <em>hello</em> directory; we can still run the binary in
<em>src/bin/main.rs</em> using <code>cargo run</code> though. After moving the <em>main.rs</em> file,
edit it to bring the library crate in and bring <code>ThreadPool</code> into scope by
adding this at the top of <em>src/bin/main.rs</em>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/bin/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate hello;
use hello::ThreadPool;
</code></pre>
<p>And try again in order to get the next error that we need to address:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo check

   |                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |
</code></pre>
<p>Cool, the next thing is to create an associated function named <code>new</code> for
<code>ThreadPool</code>. We also know that <code>new</code> needs to have one parameter that can
accept <code>4</code> as an argument, and <code>new</code> should return a <code>ThreadPool</code> instance.
Let’s implement the simplest <code>new</code> function that will have those
characteristics:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]

pub struct ThreadPool;

impl ThreadPool {
    pub fn new(size: u32) -&gt; ThreadPool {
        ThreadPool
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We picked <code>u32</code> as the type of the <code>size</code> parameter, since we know that a
negative number of threads makes no sense. <code>u32</code> is a solid default. Once we
actually implement <code>new</code> for real, we’ll reconsider whether this is the right
choice for what the implementation needs, but for now, we’re just working
through compiler errors.</p>
<p>Let’s check the code again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo check
   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)
warning: unused variable: `size`, #[warn(unused_variables)] on by default
 --&gt; src/lib.rs:4:16

   |
18 |         pool.execute(|| {
   |              ^^^^^^^
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, a warning and an error. Ignoring the warning for a moment, the error is
because we don’t have an <code>execute</code> method on <code>ThreadPool</code>. Let’s define one,
and we need it to take a closure. If you remember from Chapter 13, we can take
closures as arguments with three different traits: <code>Fn</code>, <code>FnMut</code>, and <code>FnOnce</code>.
What kind of closure should we use? Well, we know we’re going to end up doing
something similar to <code>thread::spawn</code>; what bounds does the signature of
<code>thread::spawn</code> have on its argument? Let’s look at the documentation, which
says:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn spawn&lt;F, T&gt;(f: F) -&gt; JoinHandle&lt;T&gt;
    where
        F: FnOnce() -&gt; T + Send + 'static,
        T: Send + 'static
</code></pre>
<p><code>F</code> is the parameter we care about here; <code>T</code> is related to the return value and
we’re not concerned with that. Given that <code>spawn</code> uses <code>FnOnce</code> as the trait
bound on <code>F</code>, it’s probably what we want as well, since we’ll eventually be
passing the argument we get in <code>execute</code> to <code>spawn</code>. We can be further
confident that <code>FnOnce</code> is the trait that we want to use since the thread for
running a request is only going to execute that request’s closure one time.</p>
<p><code>F</code> also has the trait bound <code>Send</code> and the lifetime bound <code>'static</code>, which
also make sense for our situation: we need <code>Send</code> to transfer the closure from
one thread to another, and <code>'static</code> because we don’t know how long the thread
will execute. Let’s create an <code>execute</code> method on <code>ThreadPool</code> that will take a
generic parameter <code>F</code> with these bounds:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# pub struct ThreadPool;
impl ThreadPool {
    // --snip--

    pub fn execute&lt;F&gt;(&amp;self, f: F)
        where
            F: FnOnce() + Send + 'static
    {

    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>FnOnce</code> trait still needs the <code>()</code> after it since this <code>FnOnce</code> is
representing a closure that takes no parameters and doesn’t return a value.
Just like function definitions, the return type can be omitted from the
signature, but even if we have no parameters, we still need the parentheses.</p>
<p>Again, since we’re working on getting the interface compiling, we’re adding the
simplest implementation of the <code>execute</code> method, which does nothing. Let’s
check again:</p>

nothing! If we were building a real, complete project, this would be a great

<p>The warnings are because we aren’t doing anything with the parameters to <code>new</code>
and <code>execute</code>. Let’s implement the bodies of both of these with the actual
behavior we want.</p>

<p>To start, let’s think about <code>new</code>. We mentioned before that we picked an
unsigned type for the <code>size</code> parameter since a pool with a negative number of
threads makes no sense. However, a pool with zero threads also makes no sense,
yet zero is a perfectly valid <code>u32</code>. Let’s check that <code>size</code> is greater than
zero before we return a <code>ThreadPool</code> instance and panic if we get zero by using
the <code>assert!</code> macro as shown in Listing 20-13:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>

    // --snip--
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-13: Implementing <code>ThreadPool::new</code> to panic if
<code>size</code> is zero</span></p>
<p>We’ve taken this opportunity to add some documentation for our <code>ThreadPool</code>
with doc comments. Note that we followed good documentation practices and added
a section that calls out the situations in which our function can panic as we
discussed in Chapter 14. Try running <code>cargo doc --open</code> and clicking on the
<code>ThreadPool</code> struct to see what the generate docs for <code>new</code> look like!</p>
<p>Instead of adding the use of the <code>assert!</code> macro as we’ve done here, we could
make <code>new</code> return a <code>Result</code> instead like we did with <code>Config::new</code> in the I/O
project in Listing 12-9, but we’ve decided in this case that trying to create a
thread pool without any threads should be an unrecoverable error. If you’re
feeling ambitious, try to write a version of <code>new</code> with this signature to see
how you feel about both versions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn new(size: u32) -&gt; Result&lt;ThreadPool, PoolCreationError&gt; {
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#storing-threads-in-the-pool" id="storing-threads-in-the-pool"><h3>Storing Threads in the Pool</h3></a>
<p>Now that we know we have a valid number of threads to store in the pool, we can
actually create that many threads and store them in the <code>ThreadPool</code> struct
before returning it.</p>
<p>This raises a question: how do we “store” a thread? Let’s take another look at
the signature of <code>thread::spawn</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn spawn&lt;F, T&gt;(f: F) -&gt; JoinHandle&lt;T&gt;
    where
        F: FnOnce() -&gt; T + Send + 'static,
        T: Send + 'static
</code></pre>
<p><code>spawn</code> returns a <code>JoinHandle&lt;T&gt;</code>, where <code>T</code> is the type that’s returned from
the closure. Let’s try using <code>JoinHandle</code> too and see what happens. In our
case, the closures we’re passing to the thread pool will handle the connection
and not return anything, so <code>T</code> will be the unit type <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>This won’t compile yet, but let’s consider the code shown in Listing 20-14.
We’ve changed the definition of <code>ThreadPool</code> to hold a vector of
<code>thread::JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;</code> instances, initialized the vector with a capacity of
<code>size</code>, set up a <code>for</code> loop that will run some code to create the threads, and
returned a <code>ThreadPool</code> instance containing them:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::thread;

pub struct ThreadPool {
    threads: Vec&lt;thread::JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;&gt;,
}

impl ThreadPool {
    // --snip--
    pub fn new(size: u32) -&gt; ThreadPool {
        assert!(size &gt; 0);

        let mut threads = Vec::with_capacity(size);

        for _ in 0..size {
            // create some threads and store them in the vector
        }

        ThreadPool {
            threads
        }
    }

    // --snip--
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-14: Creating a vector for <code>ThreadPool</code> to hold
the threads</span></p>
<p>We’ve brought <code>std::thread</code> into scope in the library crate, since we’re using
<code>thread::JoinHandle</code> as the type of the items in the vector in <code>ThreadPool</code>.</p>
<p>After we have a valid size, we’re creating a new vector that can hold <code>size</code>
items. We haven’t used <code>with_capacity</code> in this book yet; it does the same thing
as <code>Vec::new</code>, but with an important difference: it pre-allocates space in the
vector. Since we know that we need to store <code>size</code> elements in the vector,
doing this allocation up-front is slightly more efficient than only writing
<code>Vec::new</code>, since <code>Vec::new</code> resizes itself as elements get inserted. Since
we’ve created a vector the exact size that we need up front, no resizing of the
underlying vector will happen while we populate the items.</p>
<p>That is, if this code works, which it doesn’t quite yet! If we check this code,
we get an error:</p>

</code></pre>
<p><code>size</code> is a <code>u32</code>, but <code>Vec::with_capacity</code> needs a <code>usize</code>. We have two
options here: we can change our function’s signature, or we can cast the <code>u32</code>
as a <code>usize</code>. If you remember when we defined <code>new</code>, we didn’t think too hard
about what number type made sense, we just chose one. Let’s give it some more
thought now. Given that <code>size</code> is the length of a vector, <code>usize</code> makes a lot
of sense. They even almost share a name! Let’s change the signature of <code>new</code>,
which will get the code in Listing 20-14 to compile:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn new(size: usize) -&gt; ThreadPool {
</code></pre>
<p>If run <code>cargo check</code> again, you’ll get a few more warnings, but it should
succeed.</p>
<p>We left a comment in the <code>for</code> loop in Listing 20-14 regarding the creation of
threads. How do we actually create threads? This is a tough question. What
should go in these threads? We don’t know what work they need to do at this
point, since the <code>execute</code> method takes the closure and gives it to the pool.</p>
<p>Let’s refactor slightly: instead of storing a vector of <code>JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;</code>
instances, let’s create a new struct to represent the concept of a <em>worker</em>. A
worker will be what receives a closure in the <code>execute</code> method, and it will
take care of actually calling the closure. In addition to letting us store a
fixed <code>size</code> number of <code>Worker</code> instances that don’t yet know about the
closures they’re going to be executing, we can also give each worker an <code>id</code> so
we can tell the different workers in the pool apart when logging or debugging.</p>
<p>Let’s make these changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define a <code>Worker</code> struct that holds an <code>id</code> and a <code>JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;</code></li>
<li>Change <code>ThreadPool</code> to hold a vector of <code>Worker</code> instances</li>
<li>Define a <code>Worker::new</code> function that takes an <code>id</code> number and returns a
<code>Worker</code> instance with that <code>id</code> and a thread spawned with an empty closure,
which we’ll fix soon</li>
<li>In <code>ThreadPool::new</code>, use the <code>for</code> loop counter to generate an <code>id</code>, create
a new <code>Worker</code> with that <code>id</code>, and store the worker in the vector</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re up for a challenge, try implementing these changes on your own before
taking a look at the code in Listing 20-15.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-15: Modifying <code>ThreadPool</code> to hold <code>Worker</code>
instances instead of threads directly</span></p>
<p>We’ve chosen to change the name of the field on <code>ThreadPool</code> from <code>threads</code> to
<code>workers</code> since we’ve changed what we’re holding, which is now <code>Worker</code>
instances instead of <code>JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;</code> instances. We use the counter in the
<code>for</code> loop as an argument to <code>Worker::new</code>, and we store each new <code>Worker</code> in
the vector named <code>workers</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Worker</code> struct and its <code>new</code> function are private since external code
(like our server in <em>src/bin/main.rs</em>) doesn’t need to know the implementation
detail that we’re using a <code>Worker</code> struct within <code>ThreadPool</code>. The
<code>Worker::new</code> function uses the given <code>id</code> and stores a <code>JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;</code>
created by spawning a new thread using an empty closure.</p>
<p>This code compiles and is storing the number of <code>Worker</code> instances that we
specified as an argument to <code>ThreadPool::new</code>, but we’re <em>still</em> not processing
the closure that we get in <code>execute</code>. Let’s talk about how to do that next.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#sending-requests-to-threads-via-channels" id="sending-requests-to-threads-via-channels"><h2>Sending Requests to Threads Via Channels</h2></a>
<p>The next problem to tackle is that our closures do absolutely nothing. We’ve
been working around the problem that we get the actual closure we want to
execute in the <code>execute</code> method, but it feels like we need to know the actual
closures when we create the <code>ThreadPool</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s think about what we really want to do though: we want the <code>Worker</code>
structs that we just created to fetch jobs from a queue that the <code>ThreadPool</code>
holds, and run those jobs in a thread.</p>
<p>In Chapter 16, we learned about channels. Channels are a great way to
communicate between two threads, and they’re perfect for this use-case. The
channel will function as the queue of jobs, and <code>execute</code> will send a job from
the <code>ThreadPool</code> to the <code>Worker</code> instances that are checking for jobs in the
thread they’ve spawned. Here’s the plan:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>ThreadPool</code> will create a channel and hold on to the sending side.</li>
<li>Each <code>Worker</code> will hold on to the receiving side of the channel.</li>
<li>A new <code>Job</code> struct will hold the closures we want to send down the channel.</li>
<li>The <code>execute</code> method of <code>ThreadPool</code> will send the job it wants
to execute down the sending side of the channel.</li>
<li>In a thread, the <code>Worker</code> will loop over its receiving side of the channel
and execute the closures of any jobs it receives.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s start by creating a channel in <code>ThreadPool::new</code> and holding the sending
side in the <code>ThreadPool</code> instance, as shown in Listing 20-16. <code>Job</code> is the type
of item we’re going to be sending down the channel; it’s a struct that doesn’t
hold anything for now:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The code as written won’t quite work since it’s trying to pass <code>receiver</code> to
multiple <code>Worker</code> instances. Recall from Chapter 16 that the channel
implementation provided by Rust is multiple <em>producer</em>, single <em>consumer</em>, so
we can’t just clone the consuming end of the channel to fix this. We also don’t
want to clone the consuming end even if we wanted to; sharing the single
<code>receiver</code> between all of the workers is the mechanism by which we’d like to
distribute the jobs across the threads.</p>
<p>Additionally, taking a job off the channel queue involves mutating <code>receiver</code>,
so the threads need a safe way to share <code>receiver</code> and be allowed to modify it.
If the modifications weren’t threadsafe, we might get race conditions such as
two threads executing the same job if they both take the same job off the queue
at the same time.</p>
<p>So remembering the threadsafe smart pointers that we discussed in Chapter 16,
in order to share ownership across multiple threads and allow the threads to
mutate the value, we need to use <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>. <code>Arc</code> will let multiple
workers own the receiver, and <code>Mutex</code> will make sure that only one worker is
getting a job from the receiver at a time. Listing 20-18 shows the changes we
need to make:</p>

this is such a case! Take a look at Listing 20-19:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-19: Creating a <code>Job</code> type alias for a <code>Box</code>
that holds each closure, then sending the job down the channel</span></p>
<p>After creating a new <code>Job</code> instance using the closure we get in
<code>execute</code>, we send that job down the sending end of the channel. We’re calling
<code>unwrap</code> on <code>send</code> since sending may fail if the receiving end has stopped
receiving new messages, which would happen if we stop all of our threads from
executing. This isn’t possible right now, though, since our threads continue
executing as long as the pool exists. We use <code>unwrap</code> since we know the failure
case won’t happen even though the compiler can’t tell that, which is an
appropriate use of <code>unwrap</code> as we discussed in Chapter 9.</p>
<p>Are we done yet? Not quite! In the worker, we’ve still got a closure being
passed to <code>thread::spawn</code> that only <em>references</em> the receiving end of the
channel. Instead, we need the closure to loop forever, asking the receiving end
of the channel for a job, and running the job when it gets one. Let’s make the
change shown in Listing 20-20 to <code>Worker::new</code>:</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-20: Receiving and executing the jobs in the
worker’s thread</span></p>
<p>Here, we first call <code>lock</code> on the <code>receiver</code> to acquire the mutex, then
<code>unwrap</code> to panic on any errors. Acquiring a lock might fail if the mutex is in
a state called <em>poisoned</em>, which can happen if some other thread panicked while
holding the lock rather than releasing it. If this thread can’t get the lock
for that reason, calling <code>unwrap</code> to have this thread panic is the correct
action to take as well. Feel free to change this <code>unwrap</code> to an <code>expect</code> with
an error message that is meaningful to you if you’d like.</p>
<p>If we get the lock on the mutex, then we call <code>recv</code> to receive a <code>Job</code> from
the channel. A final <code>unwrap</code> moves past those errors as well. <code>recv</code> will
return <code>Err</code> if the thread holding the sending side of the channel has shut
down, similar to how the <code>send</code> method returns <code>Err</code> if the receiving side
shuts down.</p>
<p>The call to <code>recv</code> blocks; that is, if there’s no job yet, this thread will sit
here until a job becomes available. The <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> makes sure that only one
<code>Worker</code> thread at a time is trying to request a job.</p>
<p>Theoretically, this code should compile. Unfortunately, the Rust compiler isn’t
perfect yet, and we get this error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0161]: cannot move a value of type std::ops::FnOnce() +

</code></pre>
<p>This error is fairly cryptic, and that’s because the problem is fairly cryptic.
In order to call a <code>FnOnce</code> closure that is stored in a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> (which is what
our <code>Job</code> type alias is), the closure needs to be able to move itself out of
the <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> since when we call the closure, it takes ownership of <code>self</code>. In
general, moving a value out of a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> isn’t allowed since Rust doesn’t know
how big the value inside the <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> is going to be; recall in Chapter 15 that
we used <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> precisely because we had something of an unknown size that we
wanted to store in a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> to get a value of a known size.</p>
<p>We saw in Chapter 17, Listing 17-15 that we can write methods that use the
syntax <code>self: Box&lt;Self&gt;</code> so that the method takes ownership of a <code>Self</code> value
that is stored in a <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>. That’s what we want to do here, but unfortunately
the part of Rust that implements what happens when we call a closure isn’t
implemented using <code>self: Box&lt;Self&gt;</code>. So Rust doesn’t yet understand that it
could use <code>self: Box&lt;Self&gt;</code> in this situation in order to take ownership of the
closure and move the closure out of the <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>In the future, the code in Listing 20-20 should work just fine. Rust is still a
work in progress with places that the compiler could be improved. There are
people just like you working to fix this and other issues! Once you’ve finished
the book, we would love for you to join in.</p>
<p>But for now, let’s work around this problem. Luckily, there’s a trick that
involves telling Rust explicitly that we’re in a case where we can take
ownership of the value inside the <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> using <code>self: Box&lt;Self&gt;</code>, and once we
have ownership of the closure, we can call it. This involves defining a new
trait that has a method <code>call_box</code> that uses <code>self: Box&lt;Self&gt;</code> in its
signature, defining that trait for any type that implements <code>FnOnce()</code>,
changing our type alias to use the new trait, and changing <code>Worker</code> to use the
<code>call_box</code> method. These changes are shown in Listing 20-21:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait FnBox {
    fn call_box(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;);
}

    fn call_box(self: Box&lt;F&gt;) {
        (*self)()
    }
}

type Job = Box&lt;FnBox + Send + 'static&gt;;

// --snip--

impl Worker {
    fn new(id: usize, receiver: Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;mpsc::Receiver&lt;Job&gt;&gt;&gt;) -&gt; Worker {

            loop {
                let job = receiver.lock().unwrap().recv().unwrap();

                println!(&quot;Worker {} got a job; executing.&quot;, id);

                job.call_box();
            }
        });

        Worker {
            id,
            thread,
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-21: Adding a new trait <code>FnBox</code> to work around
the current limitations of <code>Box&lt;FnOnce()&gt;</code></span></p>
<p>First, we create a new trait named <code>FnBox</code>. This trait has one method,
<code>call_box</code>, similar to the <code>call</code> methods on the other <code>Fn*</code> traits, except
this method takes <code>self: Box&lt;Self&gt;</code> in order to take ownership of <code>self</code> and
move the value out of the <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we implement the <code>FnBox</code> trait for any type <code>F</code> that implements the
<code>FnOnce()</code> trait. Effectively, this means that any <code>FnOnce()</code> closures can use
our <code>call_box</code> method. The implementation of <code>call_box</code> uses <code>(*self)()</code> to
move the closure out of the <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> and call the closure.</p>
<p>Instead of <code>FnOnce()</code>, we now want our <code>Job</code> type alias to be a <code>Box</code> of
anything that implements our new trait <code>FnBox</code>. This will allow us to use
<code>call_box</code> in <code>Worker</code> when we get a <code>Job</code> value. Because we implemented the
<code>FnBox</code> trait for any <code>FnOnce()</code> closure, we don’t have to change anything
about the actual values we’re sending down the channel.</p>
<p>Finally, in the closure run in the thread in <code>Worker::new</code>, we use <code>call_box</code>
instead of invoking the closure directly. Now Rust is able to understand that
what we want to do is fine.</p>
<p>This is a very sneaky, complicated trick. Don’t worry too much if it doesn’t
make perfect sense; someday, it will be completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>With this trick, our thread pool is in a working state! Give it a <code>cargo run</code>,
and make some requests:</p>

<p>Success! We now have a thread pool executing connections asynchronously. We
never create more than four threads, so our system won’t get overloaded if the
server gets a lot of requests. If we make a request to <code>/sleep</code>, the server
will be able to serve other requests by having another thread run them.</p>
<p>What about those warnings, though? Don’t we use the <code>workers</code>, <code>id</code>, and
<code>thread</code> fields? Well, right now, we’re using all three of these fields to hold
onto some data, but we don’t actually <em>do</em> anything with the data once we’ve
set up the thread pool and started running the code that sends jobs down the
channel to the threads. If we didn’t hold onto these values, though, they’d go
out of scope: for example, if we didn’t return the <code>Vec&lt;Worker&gt;</code> value as part
of the <code>ThreadPool</code>, the vector would get cleaned up at the end of
<code>ThreadPool::new</code>.</p>
<p>So are these warnings wrong? In one sense yes, the warnings are wrong, since we
are using the fields to store data we need to keep around. In another sense,
no, the warnings aren’t wrong, and they’re telling us that we’ve forgotten to
do something: we never do anything to clean up our thread pool once it’s done
being used, we just use <span class="keystroke">ctrl-C</span> to stop the
program and let the operating system clean up after us. Let’s implement a
graceful shutdown that cleans up everything we’ve created instead.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#graceful-shutdown-and-cleanup" id="graceful-shutdown-and-cleanup"><h2>Graceful Shutdown and Cleanup</h2></a>
<p>The code in Listing 20-21 is responding to requests asynchronously through the
use of a thread pool, as we intended. We get some warnings about fields that
we’re not using in a direct way, which are a reminder that we’re not cleaning
anything up. When we use <span class="keystroke">ctrl-C</span> to halt the main
thread, all the other threads are stopped immediately as well, even if they’re
in the middle of serving a request.</p>
<p>We’re now going to implement the <code>Drop</code> trait for <code>ThreadPool</code> to call <code>join</code>
on each of the threads in the pool so that the threads will finish the requests
they’re working on. Then we’ll implement a way for the <code>ThreadPool</code> to tell the
threads they should stop accepting new requests and shut down. To see this code
in action, we’ll modify our server to only accept two requests before
gracefully shutting down its thread pool.</p>
<p>Let’s start with implementing <code>Drop</code> for our thread pool. When the pool is
dropped, we should join on all of our threads to make sure they finish their
work. Listing 20-22 shows a first attempt at a <code>Drop</code> implementation; this code
won’t quite work yet:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl Drop for ThreadPool {
    fn drop(&amp;mut self) {
        for worker in &amp;mut self.workers {
            println!(&quot;Shutting down worker {}&quot;, worker.id);

            worker.thread.join().unwrap();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-22: Joining each thread when the thread pool
goes out of scope</span></p>
<p>We loop through each of the thread pool <code>workers</code>, using <code>&amp;mut</code> because <code>self</code>
is itself a mutable reference and we also need to be able to mutate <code>worker</code>.
We print out a message saying that this particular worker is shutting down, and
then we call <code>join</code> on that worker’s thread. If the call to <code>join</code> fails, we
<code>unwrap</code> the error to panic and go into an ungraceful shutdown.</p>
<p>Here’s the error we get if we compile this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0507]: cannot move out of borrowed content
  --&gt; src/lib.rs:65:13
   |
65 |             worker.thread.join().unwrap();
   |             ^^^^^^ cannot move out of borrowed content
</code></pre>
<p>Because we only have a mutable borrow of each <code>worker</code>, we can’t call <code>join</code>:
<code>join</code> takes ownership of its argument. In order to solve this, we need a way
to move the <code>thread</code> out of the <code>Worker</code> instance that owns <code>thread</code> so that
<code>join</code> can consume the thread. We saw a way to do this in Listing 17-15: if the
<code>Worker</code> holds an <code>Option&lt;thread::JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;</code> instead, we can call the
<code>take</code> method on the <code>Option</code> to move the value out of the <code>Some</code> variant and
leave a <code>None</code> variant in its place. In other words, a <code>Worker</code> that is running
will have a <code>Some</code> variant in <code>thread</code>, and when we want to clean up a worker,
we’ll replace <code>Some</code> with <code>None</code> so the worker doesn’t have a thread to run.</p>
<p>So we know we want to update the definition of <code>Worker</code> like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]

# use std::thread;

    id: usize,
    thread: Option&lt;thread::JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;&gt;,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Now let’s lean on the compiler to find the other places that need to change. We
get two errors:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error: no method named `join` found for type

              found type `std::thread::JoinHandle&lt;_&gt;`
</code></pre>
<p>The second error is pointing to the code at the end of <code>Worker::new</code>; we need
to wrap the <code>thread</code> value in <code>Some</code> when we create a new <code>Worker</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl Worker {
    fn new(id: usize, receiver: Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;mpsc::Receiver&lt;Job&gt;&gt;&gt;) -&gt; Worker {
        // --snip--

        Worker {
            id,
            thread: Some(thread),
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The first error is in our <code>Drop</code> implementation, and we mentioned that we’ll be
calling <code>take</code> on the <code>Option</code> value to move <code>thread</code> out of <code>worker</code>. Here’s
what that looks like:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl Drop for ThreadPool {
    fn drop(&amp;mut self) {
        for worker in &amp;mut self.workers {
            println!(&quot;Shutting down worker {}&quot;, worker.id);

            if let Some(thread) = worker.thread.take() {
                thread.join().unwrap();
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>As we saw in Chapter 17, the <code>take</code> method on <code>Option</code> takes the <code>Some</code> variant
out and leaves <code>None</code> in its place. We’re using <code>if let</code> to destructure the
<code>Some</code> and get the thread, then call <code>join</code> on the thread. If a worker’s thread
is already <code>None</code>, then we know this worker has already had its thread cleaned
up so we don’t do anything in that case.</p>
<p>With this, our code compiles without any warnings. Bad news though, this code
doesn’t function the way we want it to yet. The key is the logic in the
closures that the spawned threads of the <code>Worker</code> instances run: calling <code>join</code>
won’t shut down the threads since they <code>loop</code> forever looking for jobs. If we
try to drop our <code>ThreadPool</code> with this implementation, the main thread will
block forever waiting for the first thread to finish.</p>
<p>To fix this, we’re going to modify the threads to listen for either a <code>Job</code> to
run or a signal that they should stop listening and exit the infinite loop. So
instead of <code>Job</code> instances, our channel will send one of these two enum
variants:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# struct Job;
enum Message {
    NewJob(Job),
    Terminate,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This <code>Message</code> enum will either be a <code>NewJob</code> variant that holds the <code>Job</code> the
thread should run, or it will be a <code>Terminate</code> variant that will cause the
thread to exit its loop and stop.</p>
<p>We need to adjust the channel to use values of type <code>Message</code> rather than type
<code>Job</code>, as shown in Listing 20-23:</p>

</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-24: Sending <code>Message::Terminate</code> to the
workers before calling <code>join</code> on each worker thread</span></p>
<p>We’re now iterating over the workers twice, once to send one <code>Terminate</code>
message for each worker, and once to call <code>join</code> on each worker’s thread. If we
tried to send a message and join immediately in the same loop, it’s not
guaranteed that the worker in the current iteration will be the one that gets
the message from the channel.</p>
<p>To understand better why we need two separate loops, imagine a scenario with
two workers. If we iterated through each worker in one loop, on the first
iteration where <code>worker</code> is the first worker, we’d send a terminate message
down the channel and call <code>join</code> on the first worker’s thread. If the first
worker was busy processing a request at that moment, the second worker would
pick up the terminate message from the channel and shut down. We’re waiting on
the first worker to shut down, but it never will since the second thread picked
up the terminate message. We’re now blocking forever waiting for the first
worker to shut down, and we’ll never send the second message to terminate.
Deadlock!</p>
<p>To prevent this, we first put all of our <code>Terminate</code> messages on the channel,
and then we join on all the threads. Because each worker will stop receiving
requests on the channel once it gets a terminate message, we can be sure that
if we send the same number of terminate messages as there are workers, each
worker will receive a terminate message before we call <code>join</code> on its thread.</p>
<p>In order to see this code in action, let’s modify <code>main</code> to only accept two
requests before gracefully shutting the server down as shown in Listing 20-25:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/bin/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&quot;127.0.0.1:8080&quot;).unwrap();
    let pool = ThreadPool::new(4);

    for stream in listener.incoming().take(2) {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();

        pool.execute(|| {
            handle_connection(stream);
        });
    }

    println!(&quot;Shutting down.&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 20-25: Shut down the server after serving two
requests by exiting the loop</span></p>
<p>Only serving two requests isn’t behavior you’d like a production web server to
have, but this will let us see the graceful shutdown and cleanup working since
we won’t be stopping the server with <span class="keystroke">ctrl-C</span>.</p>
<p>The <code>.take(2)</code> we added to <code>listener.incoming()</code> artificially limits the
iteration to the first 2 items at most. This combinator works for any
implementation of the <code>Iterator</code> trait. The <code>ThreadPool</code> will go out of scope
at the end of <code>main</code>, and we’ll see the <code>drop</code> implementation run.</p>
<p>Start the server with <code>cargo run</code>, and make three requests. The third request
should error, and in your terminal you should see output that looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo run

</code></pre>
<p>You may get a different ordering, of course. We can see how this works from the
messages: workers zero and three got the first two requests, and then on the
third request, we stop accepting connections. When the <code>ThreadPool</code> goes out of
scope at the end of <code>main</code>, its <code>Drop</code> implementation kicks in, and the pool
tells all workers to terminate. The workers each print a message when they see
the terminate message, and then the thread pool calls <code>join</code> to shut down each
worker thread.</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of this particular execution: notice that we sent the
terminate messages down the channel, and before any worker received the
messages, we tried to join worker zero. Worker zero had not yet gotten the
terminate message, so the main thread blocked waiting for worker zero to
finish. In the meantime, each of the workers received the termination messages.
Once worker zero finished, the main thread waited for the rest of the workers
to finish, and they had all received the termination message and were able to
shut down at that point.</p>
<p>Congrats! We now have completed our project, and we have a basic web server
that uses a thread pool to respond asynchronously. We’re able to perform a
graceful shutdown of the server, which cleans up all the threads in the pool.

<p>There’s more we could do here! If you’d like to continue enhancing this
project, here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add more documentation to <code>ThreadPool</code> and its public methods</li>
<li>Add tests of the library’s functionality</li>
<li>Change calls to <code>unwrap</code> to more robust error handling</li>
<li>Use <code>ThreadPool</code> to perform some other task rather than serving web requests</li>
<li>Find a thread pool crate on crates.io and implement a similar web server
using the crate instead and compare its API and robustness to the thread pool
we implemented</li>
</ul>

<p>In various places in the book, we discussed the <code>derive</code> attribute that is
applied to a struct or enum. This attribute generates code that implements a
trait on the annotated type with a default implementation. In this example, the
<code>#[derive(Debug)]</code> attribute implements the <code>Debug</code> trait for the <code>Point</code>
struct:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The code that the compiler generates for the implementation of <code>Debug</code> is
similar to this code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
# struct Point {
#     x: i32,
#     y: i32,
# }
#
impl ::std::fmt::Debug for Point {
    fn fmt(&amp;self, __arg_0: &amp;mut ::std::fmt::Formatter) -&gt; ::std::fmt::Result {
        match *self {
            Point { x: ref __self_0_0, y: ref __self_0_1 } =&gt; {
                let mut builder = __arg_0.debug_struct(&quot;Point&quot;);
                let _ = builder.field(&quot;x&quot;, &amp;&amp;(*__self_0_0));
                let _ = builder.field(&quot;y&quot;, &amp;&amp;(*__self_0_1));
                builder.finish()
            }
        }
    }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The generated code implements sensible default behavior for the <code>Debug</code> trait’s
<code>fmt</code> function: a <code>match</code> expression destructures a <code>Point</code> instance into its
field values. Then it builds up a string containing the struct’s name and each
field’s name and value. This means we’re able to use debug formatting on a
<code>Point</code> instance to see what value each field has.</p>
<p>The generated code isn’t particularly easy to read because it’s only for the
compiler to consume, rather than for programmers to read! The <code>derive</code>
attribute and the default implementation of <code>Debug</code> has saved us all of the
work of writing this code for every struct or enum that we want to be able to
print using debug formatting.</p>
<p>The <code>derive</code> attribute has default implementations for the following traits
provided by the standard library. If you want different behavior than what the
<code>derive</code> attribute provides, consult the standard library documentation for
each trait for the details needed for manual implementation of the traits.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#standard-library-traits-that-can-be-derived" id="standard-library-traits-that-can-be-derived"><h2>Standard Library Traits that Can Be Derived</h2></a>
<p>The following sections list all of the traits in the standard library that can
be used with <code>derive</code>. Each section covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>What operators and methods deriving this trait will enable</li>
<li>What the implementation of the trait provided by <code>derive</code> does</li>
<li>What implementing the trait signifies about the type</li>
<li>The conditions in which you’re allowed or not allowed to implement the trait</li>
<li>Examples of operations that require the trait</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="print.html#debug-for-programmer-output" id="debug-for-programmer-output"><h3><code>Debug</code> for Programmer Output</h3></a>
<p>The <code>Debug</code> trait enables debug formatting in format strings, indicated by
adding <code>:?</code> within <code>{}</code> placeholders.</p>
<p>The <code>Debug</code> trait signifies that instances of a type may be printed by
programmers in order to debug their programs by inspecting an instance of a
type at a particular point in a program’s execution.</p>
<p>An example of when <code>Debug</code> is required is the <code>assert_eq!</code> macro, which prints
the values of the instances given as arguments if the equality assertion fails
so that programmers can see why the two instances weren’t equal.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#partialeq-and-eq-for-equality-comparisons" id="partialeq-and-eq-for-equality-comparisons"><h3><code>PartialEq</code> and <code>Eq</code> for Equality Comparisons</h3></a>
<p>The <code>PartialEq</code> trait signifies that instances of a type can be compared to
each other for equality, and enables use of the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators.</p>
<p>Deriving <code>PartialEq</code> implements the <code>eq</code> method. When derived on structs, two
instances are equal if all fields are equal, and not equal if any fields are
not equal. When derived on enums, each variant is equal to itself and not equal
to the other variants.</p>
<p>An example of when <code>PartialEq</code> is required is the <code>assert_eq!</code> macro, which
needs to be able to compare two instances of a type for equality.</p>
<p>The <code>Eq</code> trait doesn’t have any methods. It only signals that for every value
of the annotated type, the value is equal to itself. The <code>Eq</code> trait can only be
applied to types that also implement <code>PartialEq</code>. An example of types that
implements <code>PartialEq</code> but that cannot implement <code>Eq</code> are floating point number
types: the implementation of floating point numbers says that two instances of
the not-a-number value, <code>NaN</code>, are not equal to each other.</p>
<p>An example of when <code>Eq</code> is required is for keys in a <code>HashMap</code> so that the
<code>HashMap</code> can tell whether two keys are the same.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#partialord-and-ord-for-ordering-comparisons" id="partialord-and-ord-for-ordering-comparisons"><h3><code>PartialOrd</code> and <code>Ord</code> for Ordering Comparisons</h3></a>
<p>The <code>PartialOrd</code> trait signifies that instances of a type can be compared to
each other to see which is larger than the other for sorting purposes. A type
that implements <code>PartialOrd</code> may be used with the <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, and <code>&gt;=</code>
operators. The <code>PartialOrd</code> trait can only be applied to types that also
implement <code>PartialEq</code>.</p>
<p>Deriving <code>PartialOrd</code> implements the <code>partial_cmp</code> method, which returns an
<code>Option&lt;Ordering&gt;</code> that may be <code>None</code> if comparing the given values does not
produce an ordering. When derived on structs, two instances of the struct are
compared by comparing the value in each field in the order in which the fields
appear in the struct definition. When derived on enums, variants of the enum
declared earlier in the enum definition are greater than the variants listed
later.</p>
<p>An example of when <code>PartialOrd</code> is required is the <code>gen_range</code> method in the
<code>rand</code> crate that generates a random value in the range specified by a low
value and a high value.</p>
<p>The <code>Ord</code> trait signifies that for any two value of the annotated type, a valid
ordering exists. The <code>Ord</code> trait implements the <code>cmp</code> method, which returns an
<code>Ordering</code> rather than an <code>Option&lt;Ordering&gt;</code> because a valid ordering will
always be possible. The <code>Ord</code> trait can only be applied to types that also
implement <code>PartialOrd</code> and <code>Eq</code> (and <code>Eq</code> requires <code>PartialEq</code>). When derived
on structs and enums, <code>cmp</code> behaves the same way as the derived implementation
for <code>partial_cmp</code> does with <code>PartialOrd</code>.</p>
<p>An example of when <code>Ord</code> is required is when storing values in a <code>BTreeSet&lt;T&gt;</code>,
a data structure that stores data based on the sort order of the values.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#clone-and-copy-for-duplicating-values" id="clone-and-copy-for-duplicating-values"><h3><code>Clone</code> and <code>Copy</code> for Duplicating Values</h3></a>
<p>The <code>Clone</code> trait signifies there is a way to explicitly create a duplicate of
a value, and the duplication process might involve running arbitrary code.
Deriving <code>Clone</code> implements the <code>clone</code> method. When derived, the
implementation of <code>clone</code> for the whole type calls <code>clone</code> on each of the parts
of the type, so all of the fields or values in the type must also implement
<code>Clone</code> to derive <code>Clone</code>.</p>
<p>An example of when <code>Clone</code> is required is when calling the <code>to_vec</code> method on a
slice containing instances of some type. The slice doesn’t own the instances
but the vector returned from <code>to_vec</code> will need to own its instances, so the
implementation of <code>to_vec</code> calls <code>clone</code> on each item. Thus, the type stored in
the slice must implement <code>Clone</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Copy</code> trait signifies that a value can be duplicated by only copying bits;
no other code is necessary. The <code>Copy</code> trait does not define any methods to
prevent programmers from overloading those methods violating the assumption
that no arbitrary code is being run. You can derive <code>Copy</code> on any type whose
parts all implement <code>Copy</code>. The <code>Copy</code> trait can only be applied to types that
also implement <code>Clone</code>, as a type that implements <code>Copy</code> has a trivial
implementation of <code>Clone</code>, doing the same thing as <code>Copy</code>.</p>
<p><code>Copy</code> is rarely required; when types implement <code>Copy</code>, there are optimizations
that can be applied and the code becomes nicer because you don’t have to call
<code>clone</code>. Everything possible with <code>Copy</code> can also be accomplished with <code>Clone</code>,
but the code might be slower or have to use <code>clone</code> in places.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#hash-for-mapping-a-value-to-a-value-of-fixed-size" id="hash-for-mapping-a-value-to-a-value-of-fixed-size"><h3><code>Hash</code> for Mapping a Value to a Value of Fixed Size</h3></a>
<p>The <code>Hash</code> trait signifies there is a way to take an instance of a type that
takes up an arbitrary amount of size and map that instance to a value of fixed
size by using a hash function. Deriving <code>Hash</code> implements the <code>hash</code> method.
When derived, the implementation of <code>hash</code> for the whole type combines the
result of calling <code>hash</code> on each of the parts of the type, so all of the fields
or values in the type must also implement <code>Hash</code> to derive <code>Hash</code>.</p>
<p>An example of when <code>Hash</code> is required is for keys in a <code>HashMap</code> so that the
<code>HashMap</code> can store data efficiently.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#default-for-default-values" id="default-for-default-values"><h3><code>Default</code> for Default Values</h3></a>
<p>The <code>Default</code> trait signifies there is a way to create a default value for a
type. Deriving <code>Default</code> implements the <code>default</code> method. When derived, the
implementation of <code>Default</code> for the whole type calls the <code>default</code> method on
each of the parts of the type, so all of the fields or values in the type must
also implement <code>Default</code> to derive <code>Default.</code></p>
<p>A common use of <code>Default::default</code> is in combination with the struct update
syntax discussed in the “Creating Instances From Other Instances With Struct
Update Syntax” section in Chapter 5. You can customize a few fields of a struct
and then use the default values for the rest by using <code>..Default::default()</code>.</p>
<p>An example of when <code>Default</code> is required is the <code>unwrap_or_default</code> method on
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> instances. If the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is <code>None</code>, the <code>unwrap_or_default</code>
method will return the result of <code>Default::default</code> for the type <code>T</code> stored in
the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#standard-library-traits-that-cant-be-derived" id="standard-library-traits-that-cant-be-derived"><h2>Standard Library Traits that Can’t Be Derived</h2></a>
<p>The rest of the traits defined in the standard library can’t be implemented on
your types using <code>derive</code>. These traits don’t have a sensible default behavior
they could have, so you are required to implement them in the way that makes
sense for what you are trying to accomplish with your code.</p>
<p>An example of a trait that can’t be derived is <code>Display</code>, which handles
formatting of a type for end users of your programs. You should put thought
into the appropriate way to display a type to an end user: what parts of the
type should an end user be allowed to see? What parts would they find relevant?
What format of the data would be most relevant to them? The Rust compiler
doesn’t have this insight into your application, so you must provide it.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#making-custom-traits-derivable" id="making-custom-traits-derivable"><h2>Making Custom Traits Derivable</h2></a>
<p>The above list is not comprehensive, however: libraries can implement <code>derive</code>
for their own types! In this way, the list of traits you can use <code>derive</code> with
is truly open-ended. Implementing <code>derive</code> involves using a procedural macro,
which is covered in the next appendix, “Macros.”</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#d---macros" id="d---macros"><h1>D - Macros</h1></a>
<p>We’ve used macros, such as <code>println!</code>, throughout this book. This appendix will
explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>What macros are and how they differ from functions</li>
<li>How to define a declarative macro to do metaprogramming</li>
<li>How to define a procedural macro to create custom <code>derive</code> traits</li>
</ul>
<p>Macros are covered in an appendix because they’re still evolving. They have
changed and will change more than the rest of the language and standard library
since Rust 1.0, so this section will likely get out of date more than the rest
of this book. The code shown here will still continue to work due to Rust’s
stability guarantees, but there may be additional capabilities or easier ways
to write macros that aren’t available at the time of this publication.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#macros-are-more-flexible-and-complex-than-functions" id="macros-are-more-flexible-and-complex-than-functions"><h2>Macros are More Flexible and Complex than Functions</h2></a>
<p>Fundamentally, macros are a way of writing code that writes other code, which
is known as <em>metaprogramming</em>. In the previous appendix, we discussed the
<code>derive</code> attribute, which generates an implementation of various traits for
you. We’ve also used the <code>println!</code> and <code>vec!</code> macros. All of these macros
<em>expand</em> to produce more code than what you’ve written in your source code.</p>
<p>Metaprogramming is useful to reduce the amount of code you have to write and
maintain, which is also one of the roles of functions. However, macros have
some additional powers that functions don’t have, as we discussed in Chapter 1.
A function signature has to declare the number and type of parameters the
function has. Macros can take a variable number of parameters: we can call
<code>println!(&quot;hello&quot;)</code> with one argument, or <code>println!(&quot;hello {}&quot;, name)</code> with two
arguments. Also, macros are expanded before the compiler interprets the meaning
of the code, so a macro can, for example, implement a trait on a given type,
whereas a function can’t because a function gets called at runtime and a trait
needs to be implemented at compile time.</p>
<p>The downside to implementing a macro rather than a function is that macro
definitions are more complex than function definitions. You’re writing Rust
code that writes Rust code, and macro definitions are generally more difficult
to read, understand, and maintain than function definitions.</p>
<p>Another difference between macros and functions is that macro definitions
aren’t namespaced within modules like function definitions are. In order to
prevent unexpected name clashes when using a crate, when bringing an external
crate into the scope of your project, you have to explicitly bring the macros
into the scope of your project as well with the <code>#[macro_use]</code> annotation. This
example would bring all the macros defined in the <code>serde</code> crate into the scope
of the current crate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[macro_use]
extern crate serde;
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>extern crate</code> also brought macros into scope by default, you wouldn’t be
allowed to use two crates that happened to define macros with the same name. In
practice this conflict doesn’t come up much, but the more crates you use, the
more likely it is.</p>
<p>One last important difference between macros and functions: macros must be
defined or brought into scope before they’re called in a file. Unlike
functions, where we can define a function at the bottom of a file yet call it
at the top, we always have to define macros before we’re able to call them.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming" id="declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming"><h2>Declarative Macros with <code>macro_rules!</code> for General Metaprogramming</h2></a>
<p>The first form of macros in Rust, and the one that’s most widely used, is
called <em>declarative macros</em>. These are also sometimes referred to as <em>macros by
example</em>, <em><code>macro_rules!</code> macros</em>, or just plain <em>macros</em>. At their core,
declarative macros allow you to write something similar to a Rust <code>match</code>
expression. As discussed in Chapter 6, <code>match</code> expressions are control
structures that take an expression, compare the resulting value of the
expression to patterns, and then choose the code specified with the matching
pattern when the program runs. Macros also have a value that is compared to
patterns that have code associated with them, but the value is the literal Rust
code passed to the macro, the patterns match the structure of that source code,
and the code associated with each pattern is the code that is generated to
replace the code passed to the macro. This all happens during compilation.</p>
<p>To define a macro, you use the <code>macro_rules!</code> construct. Let’s explore how to
use <code>macro_rules!</code> by taking a look at how the <code>vec!</code> macro is defined. Chapter
8 covered how we can use the <code>vec!</code> macro to create a new vector that holds
particular values. For example, this macro creates a new vector with three
integers inside:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
let v: Vec&lt;u32&gt; = vec![1, 2, 3];
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We can also use <code>vec!</code> to make a vector of two integers or a vector of five
string slices. Because we don’t know the number or type of values, we can’t
define a function that is able to create a new vector with the given elements
like <code>vec!</code> can.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a slightly simplified definition of the <code>vec!</code> macro:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! vec {
    ( $( $x:expr ),* ) =&gt; {
        {
            let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
            $(
                temp_vec.push($x);
            )*
            temp_vec
        }
    };
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the actual definition of the <code>vec!</code> macro in the standard library also
has code to pre-allocate the correct amount of memory up-front. That code
is an optimization that we’ve chosen not to include here for simplicity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>#[macro_export]</code> annotation indicates that this macro should be made
available when other crates import the crate in which we’re defining this
macro. Without this annotation, even if someone depending on this crate uses
the <code>#[macro_use]</code> annotation, this macro would not be brought into scope.</p>
<p>Macro definitions start with <code>macro_rules!</code> and the name of the macro we’re
defining without the exclamation mark, which in this case is <code>vec</code>. This is
followed by curly brackets denoting the body of the macro definition.</p>
<p>Inside the body is a structure similar to the structure of a <code>match</code>
expression. This macro definition has one arm with the pattern <code>( $( $x:expr ),* )</code>, followed by <code>=&gt;</code> and the block of code associated with this pattern. If
this pattern matches, then the block of code will be emitted. Given that this
is the only pattern in this macro, there’s only one valid way to match; any
other will be an error. More complex macros will have more than one arm.</p>
<p>The pattern syntax valid in macro definitions is different than the pattern
syntax covered in Chapter 18 because the patterns are for matching against Rust
code structure rather than values. Let’s walk through what the pieces of the
pattern used here mean; for the full macro pattern syntax, see <a href="../../reference/macros.html">the reference</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>$x:expr</code> part of the pattern matches any Rust expression and gives the
expression the name <code>$x</code>. The <code>*</code> specifies that the pattern matches zero or
more of whatever precedes the <code>*</code>. In this case, <code>*</code> is preceded by <code>$(),</code> so
this pattern matches zero or more of whatever is inside the parentheses,
delimited by a comma. When we call this macro with <code>vec![1, 2, 3];</code>, the
pattern matches the three expressions <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>In the body of the code associated with this arm, the <code>$()*</code> part is generated
for each part that matches <code>$()</code> in the pattern, zero or more times depending
on how many times the pattern matches. The <code>$x</code> in the code associated with the
arm is replaced with each expression matched. When we call this macro with
<code>vec![1, 2, 3];</code>, the code generated that replaces this macro call will be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();
temp_vec.push(1);
temp_vec.push(2);
temp_vec.push(3);
temp_vec
</code></pre>
<p>We’ve defined a macro that can take any number of arguments of any type and can
generate code to create a vector containing the specified elements.</p>
<p>Given that most Rust programmers will <em>use</em> macros more than <em>write</em> macros,
that’s all we’ll discuss about <code>macro_rules!</code> in this book. To learn more about
how to write macros, consult the online documentation or other resources such
as <a href="https://danielkeep.github.io/tlborm/book/index.html">The Little Book of Rust Macros</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#procedural-macros-for-custom-derive" id="procedural-macros-for-custom-derive"><h2>Procedural Macros for Custom <code>derive</code></h2></a>
<p>The second form of macros is called <em>procedural macros</em> because they’re more
like functions (which are a type of procedure). Procedural macros accept some
Rust code as an input, operate on that code, and produce some Rust code as an
output, rather than matching against patterns and replacing the code with other
code as declarative macros do. Today, the only thing you can define procedural
macros for is to allow your traits to be implemented on a type by specifying
the trait name in a <code>derive</code> annotation.</p>
<p>Let’s create a crate named <code>hello-world</code> that defines a trait named
<code>HelloWorld</code> with one associated function named <code>hello_world</code>. Rather than
making users of our crate implement the <code>HelloWorld</code> trait for each of their
types, we’d like users to be able to annotate their type with
<code>#[derive(HelloWorld)]</code> to get a default implementation of the <code>hello_world</code>
function associated with their type. The default implementation will print
<code>Hello world, my name is TypeName!</code> where <code>TypeName</code> is the name of the type on
which this trait has been defined.</p>
<p>In other words, we’re going to write a crate that enables another programmer to
write code that looks like Listing A4-1 using our crate:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate hello_world;
#[macro_use]
extern crate hello_world_derive;

use hello_world::HelloWorld;

#[derive(HelloWorld)]
struct Pancakes;

fn main() {
    Pancakes::hello_world();
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing A4-1: The code a user of our crate will be able
to write when we’ve written the procedural macro</span></p>
<p>This code will print <code>Hello world, my name is Pancakes!</code> when we’re done. Let’s
get started!</p>
<p>Let’s make a new library crate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo new hello-world
</code></pre>
<p>First, we’ll define the <code>HelloWorld</code> trait and associated function:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
pub trait HelloWorld {
    fn hello_world();
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>At this point, a user of our crate could implement the trait themselves to
achieve the functionality we wanted to enable, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate hello_world;

use hello_world::HelloWorld;

struct Pancakes;

impl HelloWorld for Pancakes {
    fn hello_world() {
        println!(&quot;Hello world, my name is Pancakes!&quot;);
    }
}

fn main() {
    Pancakes::hello_world();
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, they would need to write out the implementation block for each type
they wanted to be able to use with <code>hello_world</code>; we’d like to make using our
trait more convenient for other programmers by saving them this work.</p>
<p>Additionally, we can’t provide a default implementation for the <code>hello_world</code>
function that has the behavior we want of printing out the name of the type the
trait is implemented on: Rust doesn’t have reflection capabilities, so we can’t
look up the type’s name at runtime. We need a macro to generate code at compile
time.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#defining-procedural-macros-requires-a-separate-crate" id="defining-procedural-macros-requires-a-separate-crate"><h3>Defining Procedural Macros Requires a Separate Crate</h3></a>
<p>The next step is to define the procedural macro. At the moment, procedural
macros need to be in their own crate. Eventually, this restriction may be
lifted, but for now, it’s required. As such, there’s a convention: for a crate
named <code>foo</code>, a custom derive procedural macro crate is called <code>foo-derive</code>.
Let’s start a new crate called <code>hello-world-derive</code> inside our <code>hello-world</code>
project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">$ cargo new hello-world-derive
</code></pre>
<p>We’ve chosen to create the procedural macro crate within the directory of our
<code>hello-world</code> crate because the two crates are tightly related: if we change
the trait definition in <code>hello-world</code>, we’ll have to change the implementation
of the procedural macro in <code>hello-world-derive</code> as well. The two crates will
need to be published separately, and programmers using these crates will need
to add both as dependencies and bring them both into scope. It’s possible to
have the <code>hello-world</code> crate use <code>hello-world-derive</code> as a dependency and
re-export the procedural macro code, but structuring the project this way makes
it possible for programmers to easily decide they only want to use
<code>hello-world</code> if they don’t want the <code>derive</code> functionality.</p>
<p>We need to declare that the <code>hello-world-derive</code> crate is a procedural macro
crate. We also need to add dependencies on the <code>syn</code> and <code>quote</code> crates to get
useful functionality for operating on Rust code. To do these two things, add
the following to the <em>Cargo.toml</em> for <code>hello-world-derive</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: hello-world-derive/Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[lib]
proc-macro = true

[dependencies]
syn = &quot;0.11.11&quot;
quote = &quot;0.3.15&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>To start defining the procedural macro, place the code from Listing A4-2 in
<em>src/lib.rs</em> for the <code>hello-world-derive</code> crate. Note that this won’t compile
until we add a definition for the <code>impl_hello_world</code> function. We’ve split the
code into functions in this way because the code in Listing A4-2 will be the
same for almost every procedural macro crate; it’s code that makes writing a
procedural macro more convenient. What you choose to do in the place where the
<code>impl_hello_world</code> function is called will be different and depend on the
purpose of your procedural macro.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: hello-world-derive/src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">extern crate proc_macro;
extern crate syn;
#[macro_use]
extern crate quote;

use proc_macro::TokenStream;

#[proc_macro_derive(HelloWorld)]
pub fn hello_world_derive(input: TokenStream) -&gt; TokenStream {
    // Construct a string representation of the type definition
    let s = input.to_string();

    // Parse the string representation
    let ast = syn::parse_derive_input(&amp;s).unwrap();

    // Build the impl
    let gen = impl_hello_world(&amp;ast);

    // Return the generated impl
    gen.parse().unwrap()
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing A4-2: Code that most procedural macro crates will
need to have for processing Rust code</span></p>
<p>We have introduced three new crates: <code>proc_macro</code>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/syn"><code>syn</code></a>, and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/quote"><code>quote</code></a>. The
<code>proc_macro</code> crate comes with Rust, so we didn’t need to add that to the
dependencies in <em>Cargo.toml</em>. The <code>proc_macro</code> crate allows us to convert Rust
code into a string containing that Rust code. The <code>syn</code> crate parses Rust code
from a string into a data structure that we can perform operations on. The
<code>quote</code> crate takes <code>syn</code> data structures and turns them back into Rust code.
These crates make it much simpler to parse any sort of Rust code we might want
to handle: writing a full parser for Rust code is no simple task.</p>
<p>The <code>hello_world_derive</code> function is the code that will get called when a user
of our library specifies the <code>#[derive(HelloWorld)]</code> annotation on a type
because we’ve annotated the <code>hello_world_derive</code> function here with
<code>proc_macro_derive</code> and specified the same name, <code>HelloWorld</code>. This name
matches our trait named <code>HelloWorld</code>; that’s the convention most procedural
macros follow.</p>
<p>The first thing this function does is convert the <code>input</code> from a <code>TokenStream</code>
to a <code>String</code> by calling <code>to_string</code>. This <code>String</code> is a string representation
of the Rust code for which we are deriving <code>HelloWorld</code>. In the example in
Listing A4-1, <code>s</code> will have the <code>String</code> value <code>struct Pancakes;</code> because
that’s the Rust code we added the <code>#[derive(HelloWorld)]</code> annotation to.</p>
<p>At the moment, the only thing you can do with a <code>TokenStream</code> is convert it to
a string. A richer API will exist in the future.</p>
<p>What we really need is to be able to parse the Rust code <code>String</code> into a data
structure that we can then interpret and perform operations on. This is where
<code>syn</code> comes to play. The <code>parse_derive_input</code> function in <code>syn</code> takes a
<code>String</code> and returns a <code>DeriveInput</code> struct representing the parsed Rust code.
Here’s the relevant parts of the <code>DeriveInput</code> struct we get from parsing the
string <code>struct Pancakes;</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">DeriveInput {
    // --snip--

    ident: Ident(
        &quot;Pancakes&quot;
    ),
    body: Struct(
        Unit
    )
}
</code></pre>
<p>The fields of this struct show that the Rust code we’ve parsed is a unit struct
with the <code>ident</code> (identifier, meaning the name) of <code>Pancakes</code>. There are more
fields on this struct for describing all sorts of Rust code; check the <a href="https://docs.rs/syn/0.11.11/syn/struct.DeriveInput.html"><code>syn</code>
API docs for <code>DeriveInput</code></a> for more information.</p>
<p>We haven’t defined the <code>impl_hello_world</code> function; that’s where we’ll build
the new Rust code we want to include. Before we get to that, the last part of
this <code>hello_world_derive</code> function is using the <code>quote</code> crate’s <code>parse</code>
function to turn the output of the <code>impl_hello_world</code> function back into a
<code>TokenStream</code>. The returned <code>TokenStream</code> is added to the code that users of
our crate write so that when they compile their crate, they get extra
functionality we provide.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that we’re calling <code>unwrap</code> to panic if the calls to the
<code>parse_derive_input</code> or <code>parse</code> functions fail because they’re unable to parse
the <code>TokenStream</code> or generate a <code>TokenStream</code>. Panicking on errors is necessary
in procedural macro code because <code>proc_macro_derive</code> functions must return
<code>TokenStream</code> rather than <code>Result</code> in order to conform to the procedural macro
API. We’ve chosen to keep this example simple by using <code>unwrap</code>; in production
code you should provide more specific error messages about what went wrong by
using <code>expect</code> or <code>panic!</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we have the code to turn the annotated Rust code from a <code>TokenStream</code>
into a <code>String</code> and into a <code>DeriveInput</code> instance, let’s write the code that
will generate the code implementing the <code>HelloWorld</code> trait on the annotated
type:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: hello-world-derive/src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn impl_hello_world(ast: &amp;syn::DeriveInput) -&gt; quote::Tokens {
    let name = &amp;ast.ident;
    quote! {
        impl HelloWorld for #name {
            fn hello_world() {
                println!(&quot;Hello, World! My name is {}&quot;, stringify!(#name));
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We are able to get an <code>Ident</code> struct instance containing the name (identifier)
of the annotated type using <code>ast.ident</code>. With the code from Listing A4-1,
<code>name</code> will be <code>Ident(&quot;Pancakes&quot;)</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>quote!</code> macro from the <code>quote</code> crate lets us write up the Rust code that
we wish to return and convert it into <code>quote::Tokens</code>. The <code>quote!</code> macro lets
us use some really cool templating mechanics; we can write <code>#name</code> and <code>quote!</code>
will replace it with the value in the variable named <code>name</code>. You can even do
some repetition similar to the way regular macros work. Check out <a href="https://docs.rs/quote">the <code>quote</code>
crate’s docs</a> for a thorough introduction.</p>
<p>What we want to do for our procedural macro is generate an implementation of
our <code>HelloWorld</code> trait for the type the user of our crate has annotated, which
we can get by using <code>#name</code>. The trait implementation has one function,
<code>hello_world</code>, and the function body contains the functionality we want to
provide: printing <code>Hello, World! My name is</code> and then the name of the type the
user of our crate has annotated. The <code>stringify!</code> macro used here is built into
Rust. It takes a Rust expression, such as <code>1 + 2</code>, and at compile time turns
the expression into a string literal, such as <code>&quot;1 + 2&quot;</code>. This is different than
<code>format!</code> or <code>println!</code>, which evaluate the expression and then turn the result
into a <code>String</code>. There’s a possibility that <code>#name</code> would be an expression that
we would want to print out literally, and <code>stringify!</code> also saves an allocation
by converting <code>#name</code> to a string literal at compile time.</p>
<p>At this point, <code>cargo build</code> should complete successfully in both <code>hello-world</code>
and <code>hello-world-derive</code>. Let’s hook these crates up to the code in Listing
A4-1 to see it in action! Create a new binary project in your <code>projects</code>
directory with <code>cargo new --bin pancakes</code>. We need to add both <code>hello-world</code>
and <code>hello-world-derive</code> as dependencies in the <code>pancakes</code> crate’s
<em>Cargo.toml</em>. If you’ve chosen to publish your versions of <code>hello-world</code> and
<code>hello-world-derive</code> to <em>https://crates.io</em> they would be regular dependencies;
if not, you can specify them as <code>path</code> dependencies as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
hello_world = { path = &quot;../hello-world&quot; }
hello_world_derive = { path = &quot;../hello-world/hello-world-derive&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>Put the code from Listing A4-1 into <em>src/main.rs</em>, and executing <code>cargo run</code>
should print <code>Hello, World! My name is Pancakes</code>! The implementation of the
<code>HelloWorld</code> trait from the procedural macro was included without the
<code>pancakes</code> crate needing to implement it; the <code>#[derive(HelloWorld)]</code> took care
of adding the trait implementation.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#the-future-of-macros" id="the-future-of-macros"><h2>The Future of Macros</h2></a>
<p>In the future, we’ll be expanding both declarative and procedural macros. A
better declarative macro system will be used with the <code>macro</code> keyword, and
we’ll add more types of procedural macros, for more powerful tasks than only
<code>derive</code>. These systems are still under development at the time of publication;
please consult the online Rust documentation for the latest information.</p>

<p>This appendix documents features that have been added to stable Rust since the
main part of the book was completed.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#field-init-shorthand" id="field-init-shorthand"><h2>Field init shorthand</h2></a>
<p>We can initialize a data structure (struct, enum, union) with named
fields, by writing <code>fieldname</code> as a shorthand for <code>fieldname: fieldname</code>.
This allows a compact syntax for initialization, with less duplication:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
}

fn main() {
    let name = String::from(&quot;Peter&quot;);
    let age = 27;

    // Using full syntax:
    let peter = Person { name: name, age: age };

    let name = String::from(&quot;Portia&quot;);
    let age = 27;

    // Using field init shorthand:
    let portia = Person { name, age };

    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, portia);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<a class="header" href="print.html#returning-from-loops" id="returning-from-loops"><h2>Returning from loops</h2></a>
<p>One of the uses of a <code>loop</code> is to retry an operation you know can fail, such as
checking if a thread completed its job. However, you might need to pass the
result of that operation to the rest of your code. If you add it to the <code>break</code>
expression you use to stop the loop, it will be returned by the broken loop:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    assert_eq!(result, 20);
}
